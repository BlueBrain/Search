Blue Brain Search is a Python package to find sentences semantically similar
to a query in documents and to extract structured information from the
returned and ranked documents.

The documents which are used are scientific publications about COVID-19 from
the [CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).


## Graphical Interface

The graphical interface is composed of [widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets)
to be used in [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).

### Find documents based on sentence semantic similarity

FIXME (SearchWidget)

### Extract structured information from documents

The documents could either be the ones returned by the search or one whose
text is pasted in the widget.

#### Found documents

FIXME (MiningWidget)

#### Pasted document

FIXME (MiningWidget)


## Getting Started

There are FIXME steps. They need to be done in the following order.

### Retrieve the documents

FIXME

### Install Blue Brain Search

FIXME

### Create the database

FIXME (create_database)

### Compute the sentence embeddings

FIXME (compute_embeddings)

### Create the mining cache

FIXME (create_mining_cache)

### Launch the search server

FIXME (search_server)

### Launch the mining server

FIXME (mining_server)


## Installation (virtual environment)
We currently support the following Python versions.
Make sure you are using one of them.
 - Python 3.6
 - Python 3.7
 - Python 3.8

Before installation, please make sure you have a recent `pip` installed (`>=19.1`)

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

To install `bbsearch` run

```bash
pip install .
```

## Installation (Docker)
We provide a docker file, `docker/Dockerfile` that allows to build a docker
image with all dependencies of `BlueBrainSearch` pre-installed. Note that
`BlueBrainSearch` itself is not installed, which needs to be done manually
on each container that is spawned.

To build the docker image open a terminal in the root directory of the project
and run the following command.

```bash
$ docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t bbs .
```

Then, to spawn an interactive container session run
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm bbs
```

## Documentation
We provide additional information on the package in the documentation. It can be
generated by sphinx. Make sure to install the `bbsearch` package with `dev`
extras to get the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```


To generate the documentation run

```bash
cd docs
make clean && make html
```

You can then open it in a browser by navigating to `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

## Testing
We use `tox` to run all our tests. Running `tox` in the terminal will execute
the following environments:
- `lint`: code style and documentation checks
- `docs`: test doc build
- `check-packaging`: test packaging
- `py36`: run unit tests (using pytest) with python3.6
- `py37`: run unit tests (using pytest) with python3.7
- `py38`: run unit tests (using pytest) with python3.8

Each of these environments can be run separately using the following syntax:
```shell script
$ tox -e lint
```
This will only run the `lint` environment.

We provide several convenience tox environments that are not run automatically
and have to be triggered by hand:
- `format`
- `benchmarks`

The `format` environment will reformat all source code using `isort` and `black`.

The `benchmark` environment will run pre-defined pytest benchmarks. Currently
these benchmarks only test various servers and therefore need to know the server
URL. These can be passed to `tox` via the following environment variables:
```shell script
export EMBEDDING_SERVER=http://<url>:<port>
export MINING_SERVER=http://<url>:<port>
export MYSQL_SERVER=<url>:<port>
export SEARCH_SERVER=http://<url>:<port>
```
If a server URL is not defined, then the corresponding tests will be skipped.

It is also possible to provide additional positional arguments to pytest using
the following syntax:
```shell script
$ tox -e benchmarks -- <positional arguments>
```
for example:
```shell script
$ tox -e benchmarks -- \
  --benchmark-histogram=my_histograms/benchmarks \
  --benchmark-max-time=1.5 \
  --benchmark-min-rounds=1
```
See `pytest --help` for additional options.
