[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/BlueBrain/BlueBrainSearch.svg?token=DiSGfujs1Bszyq2UxayG&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/BlueBrain/BlueBrainSearch)

## Installation (virtual environment)
Before installation, please make sure you have a recent `pip` installed (`>=19.1`)

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

To install `bbsearch` run

```bash
pip install .
```

## Installation (Docker)
We provide a docker file, `docker/Dockerfile` that allows to build a docker
image with all dependencies of `BlueBrainSearch` pre-installed. Note that
`BlueBrainSearch` itself is not installed, which needs to be done manually
on each container that is spawned.

To build the docker image open a terminal in the root directory of the project
and run the following command

```bash
$ docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t bbs .
```

To spawn an interactive container session run
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm bbs
```

## Documentation
We provide additional information on the package in the documentation. It can be generated by
sphinx. Make sure to install the `bbsearch` package with `dev`
extras to get the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```


To generate the documentation run

```bash
cd docs
make clean && make html
```

You can then open it in a browser by navigating to  `docs/_build/html/index.html`.
