       "       \"novembre 2002. Il apparaît dans le sud de la Chine dans la province de Guangdong. Le premier rapport ne survient que le 14 février 2003 sous forme d'une courte note signalant 305 cas et cinq décès entre le 16 novembre et le 09 février dans cette même province. Le ministère chinois de la Santé attribue cette pathologie à Chlamydia pneumoniae. Le 21 février, un médecin de 65 ans provenant de la province de Guangdong loge au 9 e étage de l'hôtel Métropole à Hong Kong ; il avait traité des patients atteints de SARS avant son départ et est symptomatique dès son arrivée. Fin février, une épidémie de pneumonie touchait Hanoi et Hong Kong. L'épidémie s'étendra rapidement, justifiant, le 12 mars 2003, la publication d'une alerte mondiale par l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS) [56]. L'OMS propose l'acronyme « SARS » et des critères de définition des cas le 15 mars qui seront modifiés le 16 juillet. L'épidémie va rapidement se propager dans le monde et touchera 8437 personnes. Le 24 mars 2003, l'agent responsable sera isolé à la fois par la Chine et les États-Unis, il s'agit d'un nouveau coronavirus. La relation avec l'épidémie de Guangdong ne sera officialisée que le 28 mars. L'épidémie sera officiellement déclarée terminée le 5 juillet 2003.\\nDiagnostic confirmé : anticorps anti-SARS-CoV dans le sérum ou SARS-CoV ARN par RT-PCR (2 séries de primers) ou isolement du SARS-CoV. • Négatif : absence d'anticorps anti-SARS-CoV dans un sérum obtenu au-delà de 28 jours. • Indéterminé : tests de laboratoire non faits ou en cours. De ces éléments émane une classification en : • cas probable : le patient présente les critères cliniques d'atteinte respiratoire sévère d'étiologie inconnue, les critères d'exposition épidémiologique et les critères biologiques confirmés ou indéterminés ; • cas suspect : le patient présente les critères cliniques d'atteinte respiratoire modérée d'étiologie inconnue, les critères d'exposition épidémiologique et les critères biologiques confirmés ou indéterminés\\nméthodes diagnostiques sont maintenant disponibles pour tenter de caractériser les infections liées au CMV et les différencier d'une exposition antérieure avec un virus restant latent. 2.1.3.1. La culture virale. Le CMV est cultivé de façon traditionnelle sur culture de fibroblastes où il produit un effet cytopathogène caractéristique confirmé par technique de fluorescence. Cette technique a cependant une faible valeur prédictive, est lente et n'est pas quantitative. Sa sensibilité est inférieure à celle de la PCR. Une certaine amélioration de la technique dite « rapide » a permis de diminuer la durée de culture à 48 heures en réalisant une centrifugation des échantillons sur une monocouche de fibroblastes avant la recherche de l'effet cytopathogène par anticorps monoclonaux [15]. 2.1.3.2. La détection des acides nucléiques. Les méthodes de type PCR sont utilisées de façon de plus en plus systématique pour documenter une infection à CMV. Les résultats sont cependant assez hétérogènes d'une publication à l'autre et en fonction du type d'échantillon analysé. Dans une étude regroupant 363 patients atteints de pneumonie interstitielle, la PCR CMV s'est avérée positive pour 58 des 882 échantillons testés [16]. En prenant l'histologie comme « gold standard », les auteurs ont ainsi pu calculer une VPP et VPN de respectivement 100 et 98,8 % pour le LBA, la sensibilité et la spécificité étant de 90,9 et 100 % pour ce même prélèvement. Si l'analyse était réalisée sur un prélèvement non protégé, une légère diminution de ces valeurs était observée, la VPN demeurant néanmoins à 99,7 % et la spécificité à 99,7 %. Ces résultats particulièrement intéressants placent cette technique comme l'une des mieux adaptées au diagnostic d'infection à CMV. 2.1.3.4. La détection d'antigène.

       "       'and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus of the 45 genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae. It occurs as seven, antigenically diverse 46 serotypes; A, O, C, Asia 1, South African Territories (SAT) 1, 2 and 3. It is the causative agent 47 of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious disease of cloven-hooved animals 48 affecting most notably cattle, pigs, sheep and goats in addition to wild species such as the 49 African buffalo. Disease outbreaks have serious economic implications resulting from trade 50 restrictions, reduced productivity and the slaughter of infected and at-risk animals (1). The 51 2001 outbreak in the UK caused economic losses of over £8 billion to the tourism and 52 agricultural sectors. Inactivated virus vaccines are used in countries in which FMD is endemic, 53 but these are often strain-specific and provide little cross protection between serotypes (2). 54 Antigenic variation together with the relatively short duration of immunity following 55 vaccination combine to complicate control of the disease (3). In addition, the carrier state, in 56 which asymptomatically infected animals continue to shed virus, contributes to the spread of 57 FMDV (4). An improved understanding of the viral life cycle may be important for the 58 development of improved vaccines and other control measures. 59 60 The FMDV genome (approximately 8.4 kb) consists of a single open reading frame flanked by 61 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (figure 1A) (5). The translated region encodes both 62 structural and non-structural proteins. The P1 region encodes the capsid structural proteins VP1, 63\\n73 large poly-C tract of variable length (which can be up to 200 nt), a region containing two to 74 four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs), the cis acting replication element (cre) and the 75 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (5, 11, 12). Of these five structural domains, functions have 76 been ascribed to only two, the cre and IRES. The cre region is involved in uridylation of the 77 RNA primer peptide, VPg (also known as 3B), and the IRES determines the initiation of 78 translation of the viral polyprotein (13, 14). The roles of the S-fragment, the poly-C tract and 79 the PKs in viral replication are not fully elucidated, however recent studies have shown that 80 truncations to the S-fragment can play key roles in the innate immune response to viral 81 infection (15-17). It has also recently been reported that viruses containing a deletion within 82 the pseudoknot region showed an attenuated phenotype in bovine cell lines while remaining 83 unchanged in porcine, suggesting a role for the pseudoknots in viral tropism (18).\\n138 1311 as forward and reverse primers respectively.

Each transcript was transfected in 255 triplicate and the experiment biologically repeated three times. BHK-21 cells were seeded 256 into T25 flasks 16 hours prior to transfection with 10 µg RNA. The transfection mix was left 257 on the cells for 1 hour before the media was changed to VGM (Glasgow Minimum Essential 258 Medium (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% Foetal Bovine Serum -Brazil origin (Life Science Production) 259 and 5% Tryptose Phosphate Broth (Sigma-Aldrich).\\nAfter a further 3 hours, cells were dissociated using trypsin-EDTA 0.05% phenol red (Life261 Technologies), pelleted at 200 g for 3 minutes and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 40 262 minutes. Cells were then transferred to a 96-well u-bottom plate and pelleted; this and all 263 subsequent pelleting steps were done at 300 xg for 5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in 0.5% 264 BSA in PBS blocking buffer (Melford), pelleted and resuspended in 1/1000 2C2 antibody and 265 left shaking at 500 rpm at 4 o C for 14 hours in an Eppendorf Thermomixer C plate shaker. The 266 cells were pelleted and subsequently resuspended in blocking buffer three times to wash, 267 resuspended in 1/200 anti-mouse fluorescent secondary antibody and rotated at 500 rpm at 268 24 o C for 1 hour before washing a final three times. Cells were then resuspended in 500 µl PBS 269 and data were collected on the LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) using BD FACSDivaTM 270 software. Data were exported as flow cytometry standard (FCS) files, and were analysed in 271 FlowJo 10 using the gating strategy shown in Figure 7.\\nof PKs was initially predicted in 1987 by computational and visual analysis of 279 the 5′ UTR sequence (12). The prediction of the presence of multiple PKs was strengthened by 280 the observation that variation in the length of this region between different virus isolates 281 equated to the gain or loss of PK-length sequence units. However, the definitive demonstration 282 of PK structure remains a challenge. Here, we used selective 2′ hydroxyl acylation analysed by 283 primer extension (SHAPE) to investigate the secondary structure of the PK region.\\nrepresenting FMDV UTRs were folded prior to treatment with NMIA, a 286 compound that forms 2′-O-adducts when interacting with non-paired nucleotides, or DMSO as 287 a negative control. Labelled RNAs were purified and used as templates in reverse transcription 288 reactions using fluorescently labelled primers. Elongation of the reverse transcription products 289 terminates at adducts, resulting in cDNA fragments of different lengths, which were analysed 290 by gel electrophoresis alongside a sequencing ladder to identify sites of NMIA interaction. The 291 whole PK region was surprisingly reactive suggesting that it was largely single stranded or 292 highly flexible (figure 2A). To investigate if the SHAPE data agreed with the predicted 293structure, the NMIA reactivity was overlaid onto the previous PK structure prediction (12).\\n296 being unreactive, suggestive of base-pairing. Formation of the stem of PK4 was less convincing, 297 although the stem nucleotides still had relatively low reactivity in agreement with the other PK 298 models. For all the PKs, the nucleotides in the loop regions and the predicted downstream299\\nthe NMIA reactivities with the original predicted structure the SHAPE data were 308 compatible to the PK models and potentially shed new light on the requirements of the loop 309 interactions.\\nPK is sufficient for efficient replication.312    The replicon system was based on the O1K FMDV sequence which includes four similar but 313 non-identical PKs (figure 1). The PKs were sequentially deleted from the 3′ side (i.e. PK 4-PK 314 1), and replication of the resulting modified replicons assessed.\\ncomplete removal of all PKs, an AflII site was inserted into the ptGFP replicon 317 plasmid which resulted in reduction of the poly-C-tract to 11 cytosine residues. This C11 318 replicon was investigated alongside a wt replicon and one with lethal polymerase mutations 319 (3D-GNN). These controls were used to confirm that truncation of the poly-C tract had no 320 measurable effect on replication the two cell lines tested, as previously reported (37) (figure 321 3A). For completeness, we further removed the entire poly-C-tract (C0) and showed that this 322 had no observable negative effect on replication of the replicon (figure 3B). The C11 construct 323 was then used as the \"backbone\" for removal of all four PKs.\\nmeasuring ptGFP reporter expression, in parallel with transfection of a wt and 327 3D-GNN replicon, where the 3D-GNN replicon is used to monitor ptGFP expression resulting 328 from translation of input RNA in the absence of replication. Reporter expression was recorded 329 using an IncuCyte Zoom automatic fluorescent microscope and is shown at 8 hours post-\\n∆PK 234 respectively) replicated at similar levels to the wt replicon (figure 3C-D). 334 However, a replicon containing no PKs (C11 ∆PK 1234) showed a significant (~ 4 fold) 335 reduction in replication in BHK-21 cells compared to the wt C11 replicon. A larger reduction 336 in replication (28 fold) was seen in the MDBK cell line, supporting previous publications on 337 the potential role in host cell tropism (18). Replication of the C11 ∆PK 1234 replicon in MDBK 338 cells was however still significantly above that of the 3D-GNN negative control. These data 339 suggest that although the PKs are not essential for replication at least one PK is required for wt 340 levels of replication. 341 342In the experiments above PK1 was the sole remaining PK and we therefore investigated 343 whether other PKs could similarly support wt replication. We deleted all the PKs to create the 344 C11 construct and re-inserted PK4 as the only PK (C11 PK4). Near wt levels of replication 345 were observed following transfection into both cell types suggesting that there is no functional 346 difference between PK1 and PK4 (figure 3E).\\nto interrupt base pairing and abrogate formation of the PK structure were 357 made in the loop of PK 1 and the corresponding downstream nucleotides. The substitutions 358 (shown in red) created a GAGA motif both in the loop and downstream regions and reduced 359 the replication of the mutated replicon (C11 PK disrupt) equivalent to that of the replicon 360 containing no PKs, thereby supporting the predicted structure (figure 4A). Base pairing 361 potential was then restored by mutation of the relevant nucleotides in the loop and downstream 362 region to GGGG and CCCC respectively. Restoring the interaction using an alternate sequence 363 increased replication significantly compared to the disrupted PK replicon (~ 4 fold), although 364 this was still slightly below that of the wt (~ 0.7 fold decrease) (figure 4A).\\n369absence of PKs (figure 4B). This suggests that the role of the PKs in genome replication is 370 dependent on both sequence, structure and orientation.\\nstudies above suggested that removal of up to three of the four PKs present in the 375 wt sequence had no clear effect on replicon replication, although deletion of all four was 376 significantly detrimental. To investigate whether multiple PKs conferred more subtle 377 advantages for replication than were evident from single round transfection experiments we 378 carried out sequential passages of replicon RNA following transfection of the PK deleted forms 379 in competition with a wt replicon. Different reporter genes (ptGFP or mCherry) were used to 380 distinguish the competing replicons.\\nptGFP; wt, ∆PK 34, ∆PK 234 and C11 ∆PK 1234 were co-transfected into 383 BHK-21 cells together with either a wt mCherry replicon or yeast tRNA as a control. The 384 replication of each of the co-transfected replicons was compared by observing ptGFP and 385 mCherry expression over three sequential passages. Passaging was achieved by harvesting total 386 RNA using Trizol-reagent 8 hours post-transfection. Harvested RNA was purified and then re-387 transfected into naïve BHK-21 cells.\\ntransfection of the wt, ∆PK 34 or ∆PK 234 with yeast tRNA as controls showed no 390 differences in replication as expected (Figure 5A). Likewise, when PK mutants were co-391 transfected with a wt replicon after three passages, the number of green fluorescent cells 392 produced by the ∆PK 34 replicon was comparable to that of the wt, suggesting no competitive 393 advantage of four PKs over two. For both, there was a reduction in replication after the first 394 passage but recovery to near that of the original transfection by the third passage. However, 395 when co-transfected with the wt replicon, the ∆PK 234 replicon showed a similar drop in 396 replication in passage two, but showed no subsequent recovery following each passage and397\\ntransfection with the wt mCherry replicon reduced the replication of the C11 ∆PK 1234 402 replicon to background levels as seen when comparing to the yeast tRNA control. By passage 403 two the ptGFP signal of the C11 ∆PK 1234 was no longer detectable, suggesting that this 404 replicon has been out competed (figure 5C). Although the initial replication of C11 ∆PK 1234 405 was greater when co-transfected with yeast tRNA than when in competition with wt mCherry 406 replicon, the ptGFP signal was reduced at passage two and was at background level by passage 407 three (figure 5C). Replication of the mCherry wt replicon was not influenced by co-transfection 408 with the ptGFP constructs (figure 5D), as expected. Together these data suggest that the minor 409 replicative advantage conferred by multiple PKs are quickly compounded over multiple 410 replication cycles to provide a replicative advantage.\\na PK is essential for the production of infectious virus413    As replicons lacking all PKs could replicate and replicons with reduced numbers of PKs414 appeared to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to the wt construct, we investigated the 415 consequences of PK manipulation on the complete viral life cycle. The ∆PK 34, ∆PK 234 and 416 C11 ∆PK 1234 mutations were introduced into an FMDV infectious clone by replacement of 417 sequence encoding ptGFP with that encoding the O1K structural proteins. RNA transcripts 418 were transfected into BHK-21 cells alongside a wt O1K viral transcript and blind passaged 5 419 times by transferring the cell supernatant at 24 hours post transfection onto naïve BHK-21 cells.\\n427 rate of CPE (figure 6A) and plaque size (figure 6B-C) of ∆PK 34 and ∆PK 234 when compared 428 to the wt O1K virus. Rate of CPE was monitored by infecting BHK-21 cells with a known MOI 429 (0.01) of recovered virus, cells were then monitored for signs of CPE (shown as a decrease in 430 cell confluency) as measured by an automated imaging platform (Incucyte Zoom). Both ∆PK 431 34 and ∆PK 234 showed delayed onset of CPE with ∆PK 34 being the slowest, initial CPE 432 occurring at approximately 39 hours and 29 hours post infection respectively, compared to the 433 22 hours seen in the wt control. This mirrored plaque assay data where ∆PK 34 displayed a 434 significantly smaller plaque phenotype when compared to the wt control (average of 13.8 pixels 435 compared to 37.4), the slower rate of CPE seen in ∆PK 234 made a small, but not significant 436 difference (average 31.9 pixels).\\n∆PK 1234 produced no infectious virus the ability of the full-length genome lacking 439 PKs to replicate was investigated. BHK-21 cells were transfected with the same RNA 440 transcripts as above alongside additional controls, mock-transfected and transfected with wt 441 and treated with 3 mM GuHCl (a replication inhibitor) as negative controls. Six hours post-442 transfection, cells were harvested, fixed and labelled with an anti-3A antibody and fluorescent 443 secondary antibody. Cells were then analysed using flow cytometry and anti-3A antibody 444 signal used as an indirect measure of genome replication (figure 7). The results were similar to 445 those of the replicon experiments and showed that all the modified virus genomes were able to 446 undergo robust replication.

This may indicate 459 high conformational flexibility of this region of the genome.

It is likely that each of the 471\\nalthough removal of all four PKs resulted in a significant decrease in replicon and 487 viral genome replication, replication was not abolished, showing that PKs are not essential to 488 support genome replication. However, deletion of all PKs from an infectious clone completely 489 abolished the ability to recover infectious virus. This suggests that the genome lacking all PKs 490 is defective in a function associated with virion assembly and is compatible with our evidence 491 for the presence of a packaging signal in a similar location on the genome to PK1 (22). It is 492 possible that structural flexibility at this site in the genome allows the RNA to adopt alternate 493 conformations with different roles in genome replication and virion assembly. A functional 494 requirement for multiple RNA conformations may explain the relatively weak interactions 495 between nucleotides involved in stabilising the PK motif as observed by SHAPE analysis or 496 by structural prediction.\\nwas supported by funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research 503 Council (BBSRC) of the United Kingdom (research grant BB/K003801/1).

However, in both cases the PKs are located at the 5′ side of the poly-C-tract, making their location in the FMDV genome unique. PKs have been reported to have roles in several aspects of viral replication including splicing 97 (e.g. HIV and influenza), ribosomal frameshifting (e.g. coronaviruses) and RNase protection 98 (e.g. Dengue virus) (23-27). In the work reported here, the role of the PKs in the FMDV life cycle was investigated, together with biochemical probing of PK structures. The combination of both virus and replicon systems allowed us to distinguish effects on genome replication and 101 other aspects of the viral life cycle. Selective mutation within the PK domain and sequential 102 deletion of PKs confirmed the importance of PK structure and that although genome replication\\nMaterials and MethodsCells lines.BHK-21 cells obtained from the ATCC (LGC Standard) were maintained in Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\\'s Medium with glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum (FCS), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin.\\nWt, C11, ∆PK 34 and ∆PK 234 constructs all resulted in the production of infectious virus as was expected from the replicon experiments, with no alteration to input sequence.

ESVC-O-1 Acute effect of oral pimobendan on left atrial function and mitral valve regurgitation severity in dogs with stage B2 myxomatous mitral valve disease -A pilot study O. Belachsen, J. Sargent, T. Wagner Southern Counties Veterinary Specialists, Ringwood, United Kingdom Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is associated with failure of the mitral valve (MV) apparatus. In a proportion of affected dogs, MV regurgitation is severe enough to cause an increase in left atrial (LA) volume and pressure. LA function was reported to decline with increased disease severity. Pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor exerting positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects, was shown to decrease LA pressure, although its effect on LA function is not well established. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the acute effect of pimobendan on LA function and mitral regurgitation fraction in dogs with stage B2 MMVD.\\n-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Blacksburg, United States of America, 2 University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, Gainesville, United States of America Development of pulmonary hypertension is an independent predictor of poor outcome in dogs affected by myxomatous valvular degeneration (MMVD). Pulmonary arterial pressure is routinely estimated by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation to the velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (PASP_D). The accuracy of this estimation is unknown in dogs with MMVD, but experimental studies suggest that the method is imperfect. We prospectively enrolled dogs affected by ACVIM stages B2 and C MMVD for which treatment had been unchanged for at least one month. A flow-directed thermodilution monitoring catheter was percutaneously placed in the right jugular vein and advanced to the main pulmonary artery. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was recorded (PASP_C). A second operator simultaneously acquired tricuspid regurgitant velocity spectra to calculate PASP_D. Each operator was blinded to the result of the other technique. Twenty dogs were enrolled. Technical difficulties prevented catheterization in 2 dogs.\\n, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 2 Alma Mater Studiorum -University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy Left atrial tear (LAT) is an acute, life-threatening, rare complication in canine myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). This case-control matched multicenter retrospective study focussed on clinical manifestation and long-term survival in LAT dogs compared to control dogs with MMVD but without LAT. Data were collected from the veterinary cardiology departments\\' databases, selecting patients with advanced MMVD associated LAT. Signalment, clinical presentation, echocardiography, selected laboratory findings, the cause of death and survival data were evaluated. Parameters were assessed upon LAT diagnosis (time 0, T0) and at the resolution of pericardial effusion (time 1, T1). Control dogs with similarly advanced MMVD were selected based on quantitative echocardiographic parameters matching those of LAT dogs at T1. Thirty client-owned dogs were included: 15 dogs with MMVD associated LAT and 15 control dogs without LAT. In both groups, 9 dogs were in ACVIM congestive heart failure stage C and 6 in B2 MMVD. Commonly observed clinical signs included dyspnoea, syncope and weakness. No significant differences were found in age (both groups 10 AE 2 years, P = 0.89), body weight (both groups 7 AE 5 kg, P > 0.99), gender distribution (LAT group: 7 females, control group: 10 females, P = 0.46), serum creatinine concentration (LAT group: 131 umol/L AE 72, control group: 108 umol/L AE 39, P = 0.42) or echocardiographic variables between the groups. Mean left atrial to aortic diameter ratio was 2.24 AE 0.4 at T0, 2.53 AE 0.4 at T1 for dogs with LAT and 2.26 AE 0.4 for the controls. Left ventricular internal diameter normalized to body weight at end diastole was 1.15 AE 0.3 at T0, 1.29 AE 0.2 at T1 for dogs with LAT and 1.25 AE 0.3 for the controls. Pericardiocentesis was performed in 3/15 dogs. At study termination, all dogs in LAT and 10 in the control group had died from cardiac causes. Five dogs with LAT had died in the first week post admission as compared to 1 control dog. The mean survival time for LAT dogs was 53 days. When excluding the animals that died in the first week, survival times were 427 for dogs with LAT and 371 days for the control dogs (P = 0.617).\\nV. Patata 1 , L. Carangiu 2 , S. Pisanu 2 , G.M.G.

Giraud, K. Gommeren, A.C. Merveille University of Liège, Liège, Belgium In human medicine, caudal vena cava (CVC) diameter (CVC D ) and collapsibility index (CVC CI ) evaluated via Point Of Care UltraSound (POCUS) are accepted markers of intravascular volume status. In human chronic heart failure, CVC POCUS helps identifying patients requiring hospitalization or at risk of decompensation. Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is the most common acquired canine cardiac disease. It is typically associated with RAAS-activation and a subsequent hypervolemic state in advanced stages. Intravascular volume status impacts treatment and is likely correlated with prognosis. In dogs, CVC parameters obtained via POCUS are described markers of intravascular volume status. The goal of this study was to investigate CVC parameters evaluated via POCUS at different ACVIM stages of degenerative mitral valve disease in dogs.\\n, Ithaca, United States of America, 2 University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy, 3 Anicura, Oslo, Norway, 4 HeartVets UK, Porthcawl, United Kingdom, 5 HearVets UK, Dursley, United Kingdom Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volume estimates can help clinicians identify and quantify cardiomegaly and cardiac function in dogs.\\nerence intervals were created from measurements obtained on 73 healthy dogs. Indexed LV dimensions were regressed against LA: Ao in 82 dogs with mitral valve disease. Systolic and diastolic LV volume estimates obtained by the two methods agreed, showing no fixed or proportional biases. Only 2 dogs showed markedly different LV volumes between the two methods. The 95% limits of agreement were approximately 1.0 ml/kg for diastolic LV volume index and 0.5 ml/kg for systolic LV volume index. Healthy dogs had an upper limit of 4.8 ml/kg and 2.2 ml/kg (left apical view) or 4.3 ml/kg and 2.0 ml/kg (right parasternal view) in diastole and systole, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals of each of these limits included the point estimate of the complementary method. Diastolic, but not systolic, LV volume index increased with increasing LA:Ao in dogs with mitral valve disease (r = 0.28).

University, Phoenix, United States of America, 2 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, Belgium, 3 University of Missouri Veterinary Health Center, Columbia, United States of America Vitamin D has important roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Hypovitaminosis D in people has been associated with increased susceptibility and severity of illness with a variety of inhaled respiratory pathogens. Sinonasal aspergillosis (SNA) is a common cause of chronic nasal disease that remains a challenge to treat and is associated with substantial morbidity and non-survival in dogs. There is a lack of biomarkers that can predict the development of SNA and treatment outcome in dogs. Therefore, the 2 objectives of this study were 1) to compare serum 25(OH)D concentrations in dogs with SNA and healthy control dogs and 2) to determine if serum 25(OH)D concentrations can predict first time treatment outcome. Nine dogs with SNA and 8 healthy control dogs were in included in the retrospective arm of this study. Serum samples were obtained from these 17 dogs between 2017 and 2019 and stored at −80 C until analysis. Diagnosis of SNA was based on presence of compatible clinical signs and per-endoscopic identification of fungal plaques with turbinate destruction and fungal culture. Treatment was deemed successful if there was resolution of clinical signs and absence of fungal plaques on follow-up rhinoscopy. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using HPLC. Seventy-eight percent of dogs with SNA had complete fungal debridement. Seven dogs had follow-up available of which 57% (4/7) had first time treatment success. Dogs with SNA had significantly decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations (mean, SD; 26.7 ng/ml, 15.3 ng/ml) compared to healthy control dogs (40.2 ng/ml, 7.4, p = 0.03), twotailed t-test).

Decreased 25(OH)D concentrations are predictive of survival in people and dogs with critical illness. Decreased production of cathelicidin has been proposed to be an important mechanism linking decreased 25(OH)D concentrations with survival in critically ill people. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between plasma cathelicidin mRNA expression and serum 25(OH)D concentration and survival in critically ill dogs.\\nSeverity of illness defined by APPLEfast scores (P = 0.22), serum 25(OH)D concentration (P = 0.25), and presence of sepsis (P = 0.42; logistic regression) were not predictive of survival.\\nN. de Laet, C.

In animals it is common in chickens and cheetahs kept in captivity. Latest studies showed that transmission of systemic AA-amyloidosis occurs in cheetahs and involves fecal shedding of amyloid fibrils.

To date, few descriptions of ICGN have been published in cats, with membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN) being most commonly reported. Therefore, aims of this study were to characterize morphological diagnoses of ICGN by light and electron microscopy in a large cohort of cats and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Additionally, comparisons were performed with cats affected by non immune-complex glomerulonephritis (non-ICGN). Renal biopsies of cats with ICGN and non-ICGN examined between 2010 and 2019 were considered if both light and electron microscopy were available. Data collected for analysis included breed, sex, age, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) status, serum creatinine concentration, urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Differences between morphological diagnoses of ICGN and non-ICGN, including tubulointerstitial damage score, were investigated with Kruskal-Wallis and chisquared tests. The likelihood of diagnosing ICGN versus non-ICGN was explored with logistic regression.Sixty-eight cats were included, 37 (54.4%) with ICGN and 31 (45.6%) with non-ICGN.

ISCAID-O-2 Prognostic value of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) presence, serum acute phase proteins, cholesterol and total thyroxine concentrations in cats with feline panleukopenia: a retrospective cohort study in 70 cats (2010-2018) M. Petini 1 , M. Drigo 2 , A. Zoia 1 1 San Marco Veterinary Clinic, Veggiano, Italy, 2 University of Padova, Padova, Italy Feline parvovirus (FPV) is a common infectious agent and can be lethal. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of SIRS presence, serum concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin, cholesterol and total thyroxine (tT4) in feline panleukopenia. Retrospective cohort study enrolling cats with feline panleukopenia presented between January 2010 and January 2018. Definitive diagnosis of feline panleukopenia required a positive direct ELISA assay on feces and/or a positive PCR on feces and/or blood. According to their survival status at 28-days from presentation cats were divided into survivors and nonsurvivors. The prognostic importance at presentation of the variables age, sex and reproductive status, presence of SIRS, serum concentrations of SAA, haptoglobin, cholesterol and tT4 (measured on left over serum sample) was investigated univariately and by multivariabile Cox proportional-hazards regression model. Finally, ROC curve analysis was used to identify the best cutoff value (Youden index) for discriminating survivors from nonsurvivors for the prognostic variables resulted statistically significant in multivariable analysis. For all analyses the significance was set to α = 0.05. Seventy cats were eligible for the study, 47 (67%) survivors and 23 (33%) nonsurvivors. At presentation, nonsurvivors were significantly (U = 314.5, P = 0.005) younger than survivors, while no difference in reproductive status was found. There was a significant difference (χ 2 = 8.02; P = 0.005) in the number of cats fulfilling SIRS criteria between survivors (9/47, 19%) and nonsurvivor (12/23, 52%). SAA concentrations were significantly lower (U = 749, P = 0.009) in survivors (median = 83.3 μg/dL; range, 0.1 00 \\'248.4 μg/dL) compared with nonsurvivors (median = 138.3 μg/dL; range, 3.2 00 \\'235.8 μg/dL). Serum haptoglobin concentrations were significantly lower (t = −3.24, P = 0.002) in survivors (mean = 136.13 AE 69.80 mg/dL) compared with nonsurvivors (mean = 190.09 AE 55.25 mg/dL), while no difference in serum cholesterol concentrations were found. Finally, serum tT4 concentrations were significantly higher (t = 3.546, P = 0.001) in survivors (mean = 1.38 AE 0.66 μg/dL) compared with nonsurvivors. In the Cox proportional-hazards regression model only serum tT4 concentration was significantly associated with survival (HR =\\ncaliciviruses (FCV) are common feline pathogens causing \"flu\"like signs.

Onset of signs was ≤10 days after hospital admission for surgery in 19/20 cases. FCV vaccination status, where known, was current in 15/16 cases. Overall mortality was 45%. Phylogenetic analysis of full FCV genomes revealed co-infections of two FCV lineages in NSW and a separate lineage in QLD. Dose-response inhibition of both FCV-VSD strains was obtained with all antivirals; NTZ EC 50, 0.4-0.6 μM, TI 21, 2CMC EC 50, 2.7-5.3 μM, TI >18, NITD-008, EC 50 0.5 to 0.9 μM, TI >111.FCV-VSD outbreaks continue to occur in vaccinated cats and are associated with high mortality.

This study evaluated prevalence of FCV antibodies in healthy adult cats and their antibody response to FCV vaccination. Cats >1 year (n = 111) that had not received vaccinations within 12 months received a vaccine containing inactivated FCV antigen strains 431 and G1. On day 0, 7, 28, FCV antibodies were determined in leftover samples by virus neutralization (VN) using isolate KS20, and by p66 antigen ELISA. Factors associated with presence of antibodies and response to vaccination were determined by uni-and multivariate statistical analysis. Pre-vaccination antibodies were detected in 62.7% (69/111) of cats (95%CI: 52.9-70.1) by VN and 77.2% (71/92; 95%CI: 67.5-84.6) by ELISA. A ≥ 4-fold titre increase after vaccination was observed in 13.6% (15/110; 95%CI: 8.3-21.4) by VN and 33.7% (28/83; 95%CI: 24.5-44.5) by ELISA.Cats ≥2 years were more likely to have pre-vaccination VN antibodies than cats <2 years (OR: = 7.194; P = 0.021). Presence of VN antibodies was also correlated with the cats´vaccination status (OR: 3.472; P = 0.014).\\n.

The aim of this study is to describe DA treatment regimens and their association with post diagnosis survival times. This retrospective study evaluated dogs diagnosed with DA from 13 veterinary referral centres (private and University) from around Australia over a 10-year period (January 2007 to June 2017). Inclusion criteria included consistent diagnostic findings and a positive culture for Aspergillus from a sterile site or a positive serum galactomannan assay. The data were analysed using survival analysis. The outcome of interest was the length of time (in days) between the date of diagnosis and the date of death or euthanasia due to DA. Factors influencing survival time post diagnosis were quantified using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Here the data were organised into counting process format which allowed us to quantify the effect of each antifungal agent on survival time.\\nTrichuris vulpis infection: a retrospective study of 45 cases M.

Krafft VetAgro Sup, Marcy l\\'Étoile, France Trichuris vulpis (Tv) is a parasite of canids large intestine with a worldwide distribution. Despite its well-known epidemiology, its pathogenic impact in dogs remains controversial. The aim of the current retrospective study was to describe clinical and biological signs and treatment response in dogs naturally infected with Tv. Our medical database was searched for cases with Tv eggs identified on fecal analysis between 2002 and 2018. Dogs were classified as mono-infected by Tv (G1) or poly-infected (Tv and other parasitic species; G2) and the intensity of Tv fecal excretion (FE) was quantified (number of Tv eggs/5 g of feces). Dogs diagnosed with other comorbidities potentially contributing to systemic or digestive signs, or to biological abnormalities such as anemia or hypoalbuminemia, were excluded. Clinical signs, biological abnormalities and course of the disease were recorded and compared between groups. Associations between these variables and the FE were statistically evaluated and the level of significance was set at P < 0.05.Forty-nine dogs were positive for Tv on fecal analysis and 45 were included in the study (25 dogs in G1 and 20 dogs in G2). In G2, concurrent isolated parasites were Toxocara canis (47,8%), Ankylostomatidae (43,5%), Capillaria spp (13%), Taenidae (4,3%), Isospora spp (34,8%)\\nfor respiratory and urinary tract infections (UTI) and acute diarrhea from two Swiss university hospitals and 14 private practices during 2016 were reviewed. Classes of antimicrobials, dosage and treatment duration were assessed. A justification score (JS) was applied, where sufficient clinical information was available, to define the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy based on current guidelines (1 = appropriate, 2 = incorrect dosage and/or duration, 3 = inappropriate antimicrobial choice, 4 = overall wrong treatment decision). Of 274 dogs with proven or suspected upper or lower respiratory tract infections, 171 (62%) were treated with antimicrobials of the following classes: potentiated aminopenicillins (68.4%), fluoroquinolones (15.8%), non-potentiated (NP) aminopenicillins (20.4%), tetracyclines (22.2%), first-generation cephalosporins (2%), third-generation cephalosporins, lincosamides, macrolides and nitroimidazoles (0.8% each). In 48.2% (132/274), therapeutic decisions regarding antimicrobial therapy were judged appropriate (JS-1), in 23.3% (64/274) inappropriate (JS-2 n = 4; JS-3 n = 26). Of 245 dogs with proven or suspected UTI, 215 (87.8%) received antimicrobials. In only 36.3% of these, a bacterial etiology was confirmed via culture and/or sediment examination. Antimicrobial classes used were potentiated aminopenicillins (61%), fluoroquinolones (22%), NPaminopenicillins (11%), first-generation cephalosporins (5%), thirdgeneration cephalosporins (1%), lincosamides (0.8%), amphenicols and potentiated sulfonamides (0.4% each). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed in 73/85 (86%) of the cases where bacterial culture was performed. In 20% (49/245), antimicrobial therapy was judged appropriate (JS-1), in 16% (39/245) inappropriate (JS-2n = 5; JS-3 n = 30). Antimicrobials were prescribed in 89.5% (247/276) of the dogs with acute diarrhea. Classes used were nitroimidazoles (72.1%), potentiated aminopenicillins (29.1%), fluoroquinolones (7.6%), NP-aminopenicillins (3.6%), tetracyclines (1%) and third-generation cephalosporins (1%).

To foster prudent antimicrobial use by veterinarians, a freely accessible online tool containing Swiss consensus guidelines for prudent antimicrobial use was launched in December 2016 (http://www.antibioticscout.ch). The aim of this study was to compare antimicrobial prescription in cats in Switzerland before and after the introduction of antibioticscout.ch. Cats presented to one university clinic and eight private practices/ clinics in 2018 with acute upper respiratory tract disease (aURTD), feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) and abscesses (only in private practices/clinics) were included. Signalment, clinical symptoms, diagnostic work-up, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy were assessed and the data compared to published data from cases belonging to the same disease categories presented to the same practice/ clinic in 2016 (Schmitt et al., 2019). A justification score was applied to evaluate accordance of prescription with the guidelines (JS1 = complete accordance, JS2 = different dosage/duration, JS3 = different antimicrobial choice, JS4 = antimicrobial use/non-use in disagreement with the guidelines, JS5 = prudent use not assessable).

Twenty dogs with surgically treated EHPSS and 10 dogs with other liver diseases were included. Dogs with EHPSS had a blood sample taken at diagnosis, 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. At the 3-month control visit a transsplenic portal scintigraphy was performed to determine shunt closure status. Dogs with other liver diseases were only sampled at a single time point and comprised of: Maltese dogs with moderately increased postprandial bile acids and no liver disease based on imaging (n = 3), dogs with histologically confirmed portal vein hypoplasia (n = 4) or histologically confirmed chronic hepatitis (n = 3). All samples were analysed in batch using a commercially available ELISA kit (Hyaluronan Quantikine, R&D systems, Minneapolis). At EHPSS diagnosis, median sHA was 337.20 ng/mL (158.02-790.66 ng/mL). After successful surgery (closed PSS), sHA dropped to 36.62 ng/mL (13.51-92.24 ng/mL) whereas in dogs with persistent portosystemic shunting, sHA remained higher (median 135.70 ng/mL; 56.44-312.04 ng/mL). Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed a significant difference between sHA in dogs with closed versus open EHPSS (P = 0.008, P = 0.005 and P = 0.025 at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, respectively). The median sHA of dogs with other liver diseases was 119.64 ng/mL (48.44-160.00 ng/mL), which was significantly lower compared to dogs at the moment of EHPSS diagnosis (P = 0.009).\\nmutation in carcinomas of various sites in the canine urinary tract H.

However, studies analyzing the role of HHM in WHO lymphoma types are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of HHM among different lymphoma types and its prognostic impact on survival. In a retrospective study data of dogs diagnosed with untreated lymphoma between 2008 and 2019 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were availability of WHO type and serum/plasma calcium concentration. 139 cases were included. HHM was present in 14/139 (10%) patients. Most notably only patients with T-lymphomas were affected. 9/14 (64%) suffered from peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTLC) and 5/14 (36%) from T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). HHM occurred in 43% (9/21) of PTLC and 38% (5/13) of T-LBL cases. 86% of patients with HHM showed symptoms attributable to hypercalcemia, predominantly polyuria/polydipsia, neurological (somnolence, weakness), and gastrointestinal manifestation (inappetence). In dogs with HHM, median total and ionized calcium were 3.81 mmol/l (reference interval 2.4-3.0) and 1.8 mmol/l (reference interval 1.25-1.5), respectively. Under chemotherapy calcium concentration returned to normal in 93% of cases. No significant differences in progression free survival (150 vs. 60 days, P = 0.29) or lymphoma specific survival (170 vs. 135 days, P = 0.42) were observed between hypercalcemic and normocalcemic dogs of both subtypes. According to our results, HHM is not an unfavorable prognostic factor but it is associated with aggressive T-cell lymphoma types. Prospective studies assessing the role of vitamin D3, PTHrP and PTH in HHM are warranted. of Liverpool,Department of small animal clinical sciences, Neston, United Kingdom, 2 Animal Health Trust, Molecular Oncology Group, Newmarket, United Kingdom, 3 \\'Centre for Small Animal Studies, Animal Health Trust, Lanwades Park, Newmarket, Suffolk, United Kingdom, 4 North Downs Specialist Referrals, Bletchingley, United Kingdom, 5 Animal Health Trust,Centre for Small Animal Studies, Newmarket, United KingdomMast cell tumour (MCT) represents the most common canine skin neoplasia and typically affects adult-geriatric dogs (median age 9 years).

Recurrence was identified in 3 cases after a median time of 632 days (range 15-730): one patient received only corticosteroids following recurrence (15 days after the initial surgery), achieving complete and durable clinical remission (1013 days); the other 2 dogs received surgery, which was followed by chemotherapy in one case.The median follow-up time for this cohort of dogs was 1115 days (range 282-2655). All patients were alive, and with no evidence of MCT at the end of the study period. This study suggests that MCTs in puppies and junior dogs might have a more favourable outcome despite the presence of clinical, pathological or genetic characteristics that would predict an aggressive biological behaviour in adult-geriatric dogs. Based on this, prognostic factors might need to be stratified for life stages.DisclosuresDisclosures to report.\\nNot Reduce Infusion-Related Ventricular Arrhythmias in Dogs Treated with Doxorubicin J.L.

AAS divides patients into four stages based on localized disease (I), multiple nodal sites on one side (II), disseminated nodal disease on both sides of diaphragm (III), and in other extranodal sites (IV). In comparison to the veterinary WHO staging system (WHOS) AAS considers a splenic infiltration as nodal involvement, but not as a higher stage. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare WHOS and AAS to predict treatment response and survival in 54 canine nodal DLBCL treated with CHOP between 2008-2019. Because of low number of stage I/II patients (n = 3) in both systems, these were excluded. There were nine stage III, 28 stage IV, and 17 stage V cases in WHOS, and 23 stage III, and 31 stage IV cases in AAS. No association between WHOS and grade, substage, B-symptoms and treatment response were found. Higher AAS stage was associated with substage B (P = 0.03) and B-symptoms (P = 0.002) and negatively with treatment response (P = 0.001).

Chemotherapy has been the main stay of therapy for decades for feline alimentary lymphoma. Overall response rates reported from 50-92% and overall survival times range from days to >3 years depending on the protocol utilized and the histologic form. For small cell lymphoma, treatment generally has involved the use of glucocorticoids in combination with chlorambucil (Leukeran). There is currently no standardized protocol for the use of these drugs with some clinicians choosing to continue the therapy for a defined period of time (6-12 months) or indefinitely until disease progression in the patient.

Ten cats diagnosed with alimentary lymphoma were treated with lowdose radiation. Seven cats diagnosed with small cell lymphoma were treated with 3 Gy total and three diagnosed with intermediate cell lymphoma were treated with 4 Gy total. Acute effects associated with radiation therapy were not observed. Median overall survival time for cats treated with radiation therapy was 1368 days, the median overall survival time for the control population receiving chemotherapy alone was 1161 days. Radiation therapy appears to be efficacious and well tolerated with no clinically relevant adverse effects reported. In addition to the favorable adverse event profile, low-dose radiation was extremely convenient for the patients and clients as a number of these clients have to travel long distances for treatment, monitoring and follow-up. Client compliance and satisfaction improved due to a variety of factors such as reduced number of at-home medications, hospital visits and financial burden.

Gori, A. Pierini, I. Lippi, S. Citi, T. Mannucci, V. Marchetti University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy In canine acute pancreatitis (AP) abdominal ultrasound (US) is a widely-used non-invasive diagnostic tool involved in the diagnosis. Although, no specific recent studies about the relationship between US and clinicopathological features and severity of canine AP are available. The aim of the study was to evaluate abdominal ultrasound features in relation with canine Spec cPL, severity of disease and outcome in suspected canine AP. Dogs with suspected AP hospitalized between 2017 and 2019 were prospectively enrolled. AP was suspected based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test (Idexx Laboratories) at admission. Data regarding abdominal pain were recorded and serum samples for Spec cPL were sent to a commercial laboratory (Idexx Laboratories). US was performed at presentation, and every 24 h until 2 days from hospitalization. US was considered consistent with AP if there were hypoechoic and enlarged pancreas, irregular shape and margins, surrounded by hyperechoic mesentery and/or abdominal effusion. Recently developed Canine Acute PancreatitisSeverity (CAPS) score was calculated and dogs were divided into groups (CAPS <11 and > 11. Mortality rate was assessed at hospital discharge. US positivity at presentation was compared with the presence of abdominal pain, mortality rate and CAPS using Fisher\\'s exact test. OR was also calculated. Spec cPL values were US-group). No association between mortality and US positivity was found. Twenty-two dogs (47%) presented with abdominal pain. Dogs showing abdominal pain had significantly higher prevalence (88%) of positive US than dogs without abdominal pain (P = 0.0014; OR 10.22). CAPS and US positivity were not associated, although CAPS was associated with mortality (P = 0.0021; OR 9.3). Spec cPL were not significantly different between positive or negative US at presentation, and 8 dogs had negative US at admission, which became positive afterwards with Spec cPL < 400 mg/L. Interestingly, 4 dogs were in US-group, despite a Spec cPL > 400 mg/L.In dogs with AP, changes in US could occur later during hospitalization, although the presence of abdominal pain at presentation may suggest US positivity. Furthermore, US positivity seems to be related neither with Spec cPL nor to the prognosis or the severity of the disease.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESCG-P-5Gastric mucosal pathology in Belgian Shepherd dogs with and without clinical signs of gastric disease M.V. Candido, P. Syrjä, M. Hanifeh, S. Kilpinen, T. Spillmann University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Belgian Shepherd dogs (BSD) are considered at increased risk for gastric carcinoma (GC), mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia. In humans, gastric mucosal atrophy, metaplasia and dysplasia are all linked to GC. We performed a prospective clinical trial exploring early diagnosis of such conditions. Gastroscopy with histology of mucosal biopsies was conducted to investigate possible associations of clinical signs, atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia and GC.After an online survey for recruitment, anamnesis and laboratory minimal database were performed. Canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) and signs of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) were used to ascribe dogs in two groups: with or without signs of gastric disease (Group A: CCECAI >1 and/or GER; Group B: CCECAI = 0 and no GER). Gastric inflammation, including mucosal fibrosis and glandular atrophy, was histologically assessed according to standardization guidelines by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.Mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia were rated as present or absent.Group A included 20 dogs (median age 9 years [5.5-11.6], mean CCE-CAI = 3.4 AE 2.1), and Group B included 11 dogs (median age 9.8 years [7.6-11.3]). Logistic regression analysis detected no statistical difference in histological findings between Groups A and completely of the diffuse, non-cohesive type, including four signet-ring-cell carcinomas and one mucinous adenocarcinoma.This study in BSD showed a high proportion of gastric mucosal pathological changes, regardless of clinical signs of gastric disease; even GC presented repeatedly as an occult entity. The significant association of both metaplasia and dysplasia with GC supports an indication for endoscopic follow-up of affected BSD. Extensive endoscopic screening seems, however, unrealistic for early diagnosis due to the occurrence of occult disease. To address this problem, research on serum biomarkers for GC should be pursued. Future studies should also revise the diagnostic criteria for atrophy.Keywords: gastric, carcinoma, atrophic gastritis, metaplasia, dysplasia, dog.DisclosuresDisclosures to report.Statement of Disclosures -Marcus ViniciusCandido The author has the following disclosures related to their presentation: Employee/salary: Marcus Vinicius Candido has worked in zoos in southern Brazil, having researched on various topics.

ESCG-P-6 Effect of stem cell therapy on serum cobalamin levels in dogs diagnosed with chronic enteritis without cobalamin supplementation J.I. Cristóbal Verdejo, F.J. Duque Carrasco, C. Zaragoza Bayle, R. Barrera Chacón, P. Ruiz Tapia, B. Macías García, J. Usón Casaús, E.M. Pérez Merino Hospital Clínico Veterinario de la Universidad de Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain Cobalamin deficiency is a common finding in dogs diagnosed with chronic enteropathy (CE) due to low absorption and/or bacterial competition. It has been described the importance of hypocobalaminaemia in the long-term prognosis of these patients being cobalamin supplementation highly recommended. Treatment of CE constitutes a therapeutic challenge and new approaches include stem cell therapy. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Extremadura. A single dose of canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of allogeneic adipose origin at 2-4 x 10 6 cells per kilogram of weight was parenterally administered. A blood sample was obtained prior MSCs administration and subsequent cobalamin checkups were performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months; blood samples were submitted to a reference laboratory (Laboklin, Madrid, Spain). Clinical improvement was assessed at the same time points by the Clinical Activity Index (CIBDAI; clinically normal <3). The data were analyzed using a Saphiro-Wilk test and a repeated measures One-Way ANOVA followed by a Dunns or a Holm Sidak post-hoc test; P < 0.05 was considered as significant and results are expressed as mean AE SE of the mean. At the beginning of the study, 75% of dogs (15/20) presented hypocobalaminaemia (<300 pg/ml; laboratorial reference value). Statistically significant differences were observed between pre-treatment cobalamin values (225.3 AE 26 pg/ml) and those analyzed at 3 (360.7 AE 33.5 pg/ml), 6 (423 AE 55.7 pg/ml) and 12 (602.6 AE 54 pg/ml) months of treatment (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between pretreatment values and those obtained after one month of MSCs administration (299.2 AE 41 pg/ml). The CIBDAI significantly improved at all the checkups ranging from 8.2 AE 0.6 (pre-treatment) to 0.7 AE 0.3 (twelve months). CIBDAI was <3 for all groups treated with MSCs. Our results demonstrate that administration of MSCs leads to an increase in serum cobalamin in dogs diagnosed with CE. This increase is associated with an improvement of their clinical status and therefore, MSCs therapy should be considered for the treatment of dogs affected with CE due to their positive impact on the long-term prognosis.

ESCG-P-7 Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a biomarker in dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathies A. Becher 1 , J.S. Suchodolski 2 , J.M. Steiner 2 , R.M. Heilmann 3 1 College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany, 2 Texas A&M University, College Station, United States of America, 3 University of Leipzig, College of Veterinary Medic, Leipzig, Germany Chronic inflammatory enteropathies (CIE) comprise an important group of diseases in dogs. Only few biomarkers that can be routinely measured (eg, serum cobalamin and albumin, fecal calprotectin) appear to be of clinical utility in dogs with CIE and can potentially aid in CIE subclassification based on the response to treatment (ie, diagnosis of food-responsive enteropathy [FRE] vs. steroid−/immunosuppressantresponsive enteropathy [IRE]). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was recently shown to have diagnostic and prognostic potential in humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NLR also appears to be useful in the diagnosis of dogs with hypoadrenocorticism, but the NLR has not been evaluated or reported in dogs with CIE. Data from 91 dogs diagnosed with CIE (that had not received steroids for ≥2 weeks prior to diagnostic evaluation) at 2 veterinary centers were used for this study. NLR was calculated as [neutrophil count/ lymphocyte count] and was evaluated for a potential relationship with the severity of clinical signs (CCECAI scoring system, n = 65), serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations (n = 65), histologic lesion severity (4-point semi-quantitative grading system, n = 36), serum and fecal concentrations of other inflammatory markers (n = 60), and the response to treatment (FRE vs. IRE, n = 39). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. NLR ranged from 0.23-54.0 (median: 5.69) in all dogs with CIE. NLR was significantly higher in dogs with very severe clinical signs compared to dogs with mild (P = 0.014) or moderate (P = 0.026) clinicaldisease. NLR was not correlated with the overall histologic score (P > 0.05), but was significantly higher in dogs with histologic lesions compatible with protein-losing enteropathy (P = 0.006). Hypoalbuminemia (P < 0.001), but not hypocobalaminemia, was significantly associated with a higher NLR. NLR correlated significantly with serum S100A12 (P = 0.032), C-reactive protein (P = 0.046), decoy receptor for advanced glycation end products (P = 0.034), and fecal alpha 1proteinase inhibitor (P < 0.001), but not with serum or fecal calprotectin concentrations. Dogs with IRE (n = 26) had significantly higher NLRs (median: 8.41) than dogs with FRE (median: 3.09; n = 13; P = 0.008), and an NLR ≥4.60 best distinguished dogs with IRE from those with FRE (sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 69%).Our findings suggest that neutrophils play a role in the systemic inflammatory response associated with CIE in dogs. NLR (ie., leukogram changes) in canine CIE are of similar magnitude as in human IBD. NLR can be easily obtained during routine hematology, and can potentially aid in the subclassification of dogs with CIE. The potential utility of NLR in the monitoring of dogs with CIE requires further investigation.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.Not applicable.ESCG-P-8 Calprotectin concentrations are increased in the intestinal mucosa of dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathies M.

Moniz 3 , K. 2+ − binding protein of the S100/calgranulin family, has potential as a marker of inflammation in dogs and mainly originating from granulocytes. Increased canine calprotectin concentrations have been detected in feces and serum samples from dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE). However, intestinal mucosal calprotectin concentrations have not been extensively investigated in canine CIE. We evaluated the mucosal concentrations of calprotectin in dogs with CIE in comparison with healthy Beagle dogs using a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) method on a clinical chemistry analyzer. Additionally, we assessed the association of mucosal calprotectin levels with the canine clinical IBD activity index (CIBDAI), histopathologic findings, clinical outcome, and serum albumin concentrations. Intestinal mucosal biopsies were collected from 38 dogs with CIE (duodenum [n = 34], ileum [n = 10], colon [n = 14], and caecum [n = 7]). Archived intestinal tissue samples from 18 healthy Beagle dogs served as controls (duodenum [n = 17], ileum [n = 18], colon [n = 18], and caecum [n = 6]). Data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges). In comparison to healthy Beagles, mucosal calprotectin concentrations of CIE-dogs were higher in the duodenum (332 [91-639] vs. 94 [24-137] μg/L; P = 0.001) and colon (380 [187-542] vs. 112 [36-196] μg/L; P = 0.002). Histologic severity was significantly associated with mucosal calprotectin levels (P < 0.05) for total histopathology score, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the duodenum, and epithelial injury in the colon. Duodenal calprotectin concentrations were higher in hypoalbuminemic dogs than normoalbuminemic dogs (1441 [1098-1748] μg/L vs. 227 [74-506] μg/L), but because of the small number of hypoalbuminemic dogs (n = 4) the results were only descriptively reported. There was no significant association of mucosal calprotectin levels with CIBDAI scores or with the clinical outcome. This study showed that mucosal calprotectin concentrations are increased in the duodenum and colon of dogs with CIE. The results provide supporting evidence for the potential diagnostic value of mucosal (or fecal) calprotectin concentrations in dogs with CIE. Further prospective research is needed to assess the value of measuring mucosal calprotectin concentrations in clinical practice, the relationship between mucosal and fecal calprotectin, and other inflammatory markers in dogs with CIE.\\nNovel Canine-Specific Model System to Study Intestinal P-Glycoprotein-Mediated Drug Transport Y.M.

The aim of this research was to evaluate P-gp functional activity and expression in canine ENT vs. intestinal tissues. P-gp expression was assessed using qPCR of intestinal tissues and ENT from the ileum of 3 healthy and diseased dogs. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of canine ileal ENT in transwell culture was performed to assess the localization of P-gp transporters.

Allenspach Iowa State University, Ames, United States of America Dietary fat composition has been shown to modulate fecal microbiota composition and impact host health. High-fat diets have been linked to reduced fecal microbial diversity, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and low-grade systemic (LPS) inflammation. While high-fat diets may modulate the fecal microbiota, there is no data available on the impact of high-fat diets on the canine mucosal microbiota. The aim of the study was to investigate changes in composition of the mucosal microbiota and serum metabolome in Beagle dogs fed two rations varying in their content of dietary fat. Eight healthy adult Beagle dogs were fed a control diet (13% fat), followed by low-carbohydrate diet (1% starch) containing either 32% fat (T1) or 46.5% fat (T2) for 2 weeks each in randomized order. Endoscopic biopsies of the small and large intestines and sera were collected for analysis of mucosal microbiota and metabolomic profiles, respectively, before and during dietary intervention. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a 4-probe array (ie, total bacteria, Firmicutes [Clostridium cluster XIVa], Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae) quantified colonic mucosal bacteria into distinct compartments. Serum metabolomic profiles resulting from the different diets were quantified by a targeted approach to analyze samples using mass spectrometry and the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p400 HR Kit. Metabolite changes between diets were analyzed by PCA, PLS-DA, the adherent mucus. There was no difference in the total number and spatial distribution of bacteria within the mucosa of dogs fed control diet versus T1. For the different bacterial groups, sub-populations of Clostridium spp. were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in adherent mucus of dogs fed T2 versus T1. Changes in mucosal bacteria were accompanied by altered serum metabolomes of dogs fed either T1 or T2. Perturbations in lipid metabolism predominated and primarily involved different glycerophospholipids (GPL), including the phosphatidylcholines (PC) and acylcarnitines (AC). Most GPLs were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in dogs fed T2 but not T1 when compared to control ration. Conversely, T2 also resulted in lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of other lipid metabolites and select amino acids. Our results indicate that enhanced dietary fat modified the mucosal microbiota and the serum metabolome of healthy dogs. Consumption of high fat diets has implications for canine health by modulating host immune responses in association with changes in gut microbial composition.\\nof Teramo, Isola del Gran Sasso, Italy, 2 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, ISOF, Area della Ricerca, Bologna, Italy, 3 Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, 4 Ospedale Veterinario i Portoni Rossi, Zola Predosa, ItalyChronic enteropathies (CE) are common cause for persistent or recurrent gastrointestinal signs in dogs. Food-responsive enteropathy (FRE), antimicrobial-responsive enteropathy (ARE), and immunosuppressiveresponsive enteropathy (IRE) have different etiologies however clinical signs overlap and distinguishing among these disorders may be challenging with the most reliable diagnostic tool represented by sequential treatment using diet, antimicrobials, and immunosuppressive drugs.

Although the clinician\\'s attention is mainly focused on patients with hypocobalaminaemia, recent studies in humans and cats suggest that high serum cobalamin concentration could be associated with specific conditions such as neoplasia and liver disease and, in addition, may be a marker of severity. The aims of this retrospective, crosssectional study were therefore to identify the conditions associated with hypercobalaminaemia in dogs and to determine whether it could be used as a marker of disease severity in these patients. Medical records of dogs having serum cobalamin measured between November 2016 and December 2018 in 14 practices in the United Kingdom were reviewed.

Hervé 3 , J.M. of Veterinary Medicin, Nantes, France, 3 Cellular and Molecular Immuno-Endocrinology Unit, INRA, Nantes-Atlantic College, Nantes, France Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic gastrointestinal disease in dogs. The current paradigm of IBD involves complex interactions between environmental factors, such as the intestinal microbiota, and dysregulated host responses. Toll-Like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 recognize bacterial Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). In a previous study, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 mRNAs were reported to be up-regulated in the inflamed duodenal and colonic mucosa of IBD dogs compared to asymptomatic healthy Beagles. The aim of this study was with IBD were included in this study. Diagnosis was based on clinical signs of at least 3 weeks\\' duration, the presence of a lymphocytic and plasmacytic and/or eosinophilic inflammation on colon biopsies and exclusion of other causes of chronic gastrointestinal signs. Nine dogs were included in the control group. Colon paraffin-embedded biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry using anti-human TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 antibodies. The expression of TLRs in the different samples was graded from 0 (no expression) to 3 (strong expression) by a board-certified pathologist in a blinded fashion. TLR5 and TLR9 were detected both in the epithelial cells and in the lamina propria cells. In contrast, TLR2 was detected only in the epithelial cells while TLR4 staining was restricted to the leucocytes of the lamina propria. No statistical differences were found in TLRs expression when comparing IBD dogs with asymptomatic dogs although epithelial TLR9 expression tended to be higher in the IBD group (P = 0,054). To our knowledge, our study describes for the first time the pattern of expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 in the colon of dogs and suggests that their expression is poorly affected by IBD. Further experiments are warranted in a larger number of patients and in other intestinal segments (duodenum and ileum) to analyze whether epithelial TLR9 expression might be correlated with clinical activity or histopathology score.

These dogs all had serum pancreatic lipase concentrations >600 μg/L and clinical symptoms of pancreatitis like vomiting, abdominal pain or inappetence and had received no medical treatment so far. Additionally, in 3 dogs pancreatitis was diagnosed by histology of pancreatic tissue biopsies. The 45 dogs of the control group had serum pancreatic lipase values <40 μg/l and had clinical symptoms concurrent with other diseases than pancreatitis.Serum Vitamin A and E levels were measured by HPLC from cooled serum within 72 hours of sampling. Dogs with pancreatitis had significantly higher (P < 0.001) levels of serum Vitamin A (average 1701 μg/L,\\nBologna, Ozzano dell\\'Emilia (BO), Italy, 2 Department of Civil, Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering, Bologna, Italy\\nof Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Iasi, Romania, 2 Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, Robert H.

A predominant sympathetic and/or a diminished vagal tone are linked to disease progression. Only scarce information about autonomic nervous system (ANS) dynamics during MVD progression is available in the veterinary literature. To our knowledge, the ANS imbalance in dogs with MVD prior to receiving cardiac pharmacotherapy has not been evaluated. We sought to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) for assessing the ANS activity in dogs with preclinical and yet untreated clinical MVD. Seventy-four client-owned dogs with echocardiographically confirmed MVD were retrospectively divided into three groups according to the 2009 ACVIM Consensus Statement: B1 (n = 20), B2 (n = 20) and C (n = 34). A control group, labeled N (n = 21) included healthy normal dogs.\\nof serum digoxin levels to avoid digoxin intoxication is performed at least 3 to 5 days after beginning therapy. Some labs discourage the use of blood collection tubes containing gel because of potential absorption of digoxin by the gel resulting in an underestimation of the serum digoxin concentration. The aim of this study was to compare serum digoxin concentrations in blood collected in serum tubes with and without gel. Blood samples were taken with a syringe and needle from the jugular vein of 48 dogs treated with digoxin (Lanoxin ® ). For each dog, half of the blood sample was put in a tube containing no gel (NGC) (Vacutainer Z) while the other half of the sample was put in a gel containing (GC) tube (BD Vacutainer ® STT II Advance). NGC tubes were sent to the referral lab (Synlab, Belgium) for immediate analysis. GC tubes were kept uncentrifuged and refrigerated for 5 days before analysis was performed. All analyses were carried out by the same lab using the ARCHITECT ci System (Abbott Diagnostics, US). Median digoxin concentration (quartile 1-3) was 0.90 μg/L (0.70-1.10) for the NGC tubes and 1 μg/L (0.80-1.10) for the GC tubes. Agreement between the two methods was shown by a mean bias of 0.05 and a narrow range of agreement (lower level of agreement: −0.09; upper level of agreement: 0.18). Mean bias (%) was 5.1% and did not exceed the method quality specifications for total allowable error (14%). Bland-Altman plot of data did not show significant differences in data sets. Serum digoxin concentrations do not decrease when collected in tubes containing gel and kept refrigerated for 5 days before analysis. Blood collection serum tubes containing gel can be used for therapeutic monitoring of serum digoxin levels.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESVC-P-3Transverse right ventricle strain and strain rate assessed by 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography in dogs with pulmonary hypertension\\n-3.3 AE 7.9), creatinine (+0.5 AE 0.27 vs. +0.1 AE 0.19), SDMA (+5.1 AE 2.25vs. +2.0 AE 5.78), sodium level (+3.5 AE 3.31 vs. -0.8 AE 3.81). The differences of heart rate (+7.9 AE 12.2 vs. -1.5 AE 9.8) and blood pressure (+14.2 AE 14.6 vs. -3.8 AE 15.9) between baseline and follow-up were significantly lower in the case group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the increased level ofNT-proBNP (1621.4 AE 1274 was also greater in the controls (P = 0.04). However, no statistical differences were found in thoracic radiographic and echocardiographic indices between the groups. Comparing survival curves of two groups did not reveal an overall survival advantage with ARBs treatment.These results suggest that ARBs in combination with ongoing conventional CHF treatments may provide an additional renoprotective effect in dogs with MMVD.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESVC-P-5 Perioperative management with peripheral arteries in dogs undergoing open heart surgery K. Takamura, A. Takahashi, Y. Nii, M. Uechi JASMINE Veterinary Cardiovascular Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan Insertion of an arterial catheter is essential in open heart surgery. The femoral artery is one of the most commonly used arteries in open heart surgery in dogs. Although peripheral arteries, such as the dorsalis pedis, have been used in veterinary medicine in recent years, little is known about their use for open heart surgery in dogs. Therefore, we compared it with conventional management via the femoral artery.We retrospectively reviewed cases involving mitral valve repair with cardiopulmonary bypass between September 2018 and November 2018. We compared successful catheter placement, catheter insertion, removal time, adverse events, and operation time in the femoral and peripheral arteries.\\nFrancesco Veterinary Hospital, Milano, Italy, 2 Cardiology Service, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milano, Italy Critically hill patients with acute congestive heart failure (CHF) may often show haemoconcentration, dysnatremia, dyskalemia and increased azotemia, due to aggressive diuretic therapy. Haemoconcentration is associated with lower risk of mortality, while dysnatremia and dyskalemia are associated with higher mortality in human medicine. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the impact of in-hospital diuretic therapy for CHF on selected laboratory parameters and long-term mortality. Dogs with clinical and radiological evidence of CHF confirmed by echocardiography were included. Blood samples collected throughout the hospitalization at presentation (T0) and discharge (T1) were: venous blood gas analysis (VBGA), serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), microhematocrit (Htc) and total proteins (TP). Length of hospital stay, ACVIM class and other clinical indices were recorded. Haemoconcentration was defined as a simultaneous increase in Htc and total protein. A total of 85 dogs (45 male and 40 female; mean age 11.07 AE 2.54 years; mean weight 8.86 AE 6.92 kg) were included. Thirty-six dogs had previous episodes of CHF. Mean length of in-hospital stay was 31.15 AE 17.35 hours. Treatment protocol included a single furosemide endovenous bolus at 2 mg/kg followed by multiple 1 mg/kg bolus/hour until respiratory rate reach 40respiratory rate. Each dog received 8.6 AE 2.8 mg/kg and 11.1 AE 2.9 mg/kg furosemide in 24 and 48 hours respectively. Ten dogs received higher furosemide doses or torasemide bolus. Haemoconcentration was reached in the 33% of dogs. Considering the VBGA and biochemistry results, the number of dogs showing extra-range values (T0-T1) were respectively: hyponatremia (10-23), hypernatremia (13-17), hypokalemia (18-30), hyperkalemia (10-10), hypocloremia (46-61), increased BUN (26-34), increased sCr (3-8).\\nState University, Ames, United States of America, 2 Tufts University, N. Grafton, United States of America, 3 Heartland Assays, Ames, United States of America Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D 3 ) has been associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease in people and dogs. We aimed to determine if 25(OH)D 3 and its metabolite, 3-epi-25(OH)D 3 (3-epi), are lower in cats with cardiomyopathy (CM) vs. normal cats, or if associations with certain clinical variables exist. CM cats (n = 44) were enrolled from patients at the Veterinary Medical Centers of Iowa State (ISU) and Tufts Universities; 38 CM cats had congestive heart failure.Exclusion criteria included hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and clinically relevant systemic (including kidney) disease. Normal cats (N) were recruited at ISU; 44 were age-and sex-matched to CM cats, although 56 normal cats ultimately were enrolled. All cats were eating commercial cat foods. CV exam, blood pressure and echocardiographic data were collected; collected serum was frozen until analyzed. 25(OH)D 3 and 3-epi were positively correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.35; P = 0.004). However, neither was significantly different between CM and matched-N groups (paired Wilcoxson rank-sum). Linear regression analysis to assess impact of CM status, age, and sex among all enrolled cats showed age was significant to 25(OH)D 3 (P = 0.0028).Statistical modeling including all variables was confounded by multicollinearity; therefore, one-by-one simple linear regression tested for relationships between vitamin D status and 18 clinical variables. Significant relationships were found between 25(OH)D 3 and age, survival time, azotemia category, left atrial enlargement, and left ventricular fractional shortening (FS). After accounting for age, only FS and survival time remained significant with 25(OH)D 3 . We conclude that vitamin D status in cats is not significantly associated with CM.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESVC-P-9 Identification of increased desmin aggregates consistent with intermediate filament dysfunction in feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy W.C.

Diagnoses were made by histopathology AE clinical assessment. Mann-Whitney\\'s U test, or Spearman\\'s rho test were used and the results were expressed as median (range).On immunoblotting, only one control had a recorded age (5.8 yrs), the other controls were documented as young adult. The median age of HCM cats was 8 yrs(1.7-17). The protein level of desmin was 0.54 (0.27-0.69) in the controls and1.41 (0.59-2.19) in the HCM group (P = 0.0159). The protein level of αB-crystallin was 0.56 (0.18-0.66) in the controls and was1.46 (0.63-2.39) in the HCM group (P = 0.0317).The protein expression of αB-crystallin and desmin was highly correlated (R = 0.8788, P = 0.0016). On immunohistochemistry, the median age was 3 yrs (1.6-5.8) in control cats and 8.5 (2-17.9) in the HCM group (P > 0.05). In controls, desmin appeared as stripes at Z-bands and intercalated discs and a scarce amount of perinuclear aggregates were observed in the cross-section of cardiomyocytes close to epicardium. In HCM cats, dissociation of desmin from the intercalated discs was a frequent finding and clumps of aggregates were seen in the transversely sectioned cardiomyocytes not limited to the periphery of epicardium.

Although some epidemiologic data and risk factors for AF have been reported, no study cardiovascular assessment (ie., physical examination, thoracic radiography and trans-thoracic echocardiography) and cardiac rhythm assessment via routine 2 minutes ECG and/or good quality ECG tracing during echocardiographic examination of at least 20 minutes\\' duration. For dogs with multiple examinations during the observing period only data of the most recent exam were considered.Selected clinical and echocardiographic parameters were compared using univariable and different multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 2194 dogs were enrolled, including 1280, 588, 290, and 36 dogs in ACVIM stage B1, B2, C, and D, respectively. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was diagnosed in 526 (23.9%) dogs. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 59 dogs with a prevalence of 2.7%. Univariate analyses showed that mixed breed, male gender, decompensated ACVIM stage, left atrial diameter-to-aortic ratio (LA/Ao) > 1.6, normalized left ventricular diastolic diameter > 1.7, and presence of PH were significantly associated with the development of AF. Also the continuous variables LA, body weight (BW), fractional shortening (FS), and velocity of trans-mitral E wave (E-max) were significantly different (P < 0.01) for AF cases. After evaluation of autocorrelation and/or interaction between predictors, two multivariable models were obtained. LA/Ao (odds ratio [OR] 14.011, 7.463-26.304), E-max (OR 2.204, 1.192-4.076), BW (OR 1.094, 1.058-1.130), and FS (OR 0.899, 0.865-0.934); and LA (OR 5.28, 3.377-8.092), decompensated ACVIM stage (OR 4.922, 1.481-16.353), and FS (OR 0.919, 0.881-0.959) were significant predictors of AF for model 1 and 2, respectively. An LA > 3.45 cm had sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 89.8% to predict development of AF. Atrial fibrillation is an uncommon complication of canine MMVD and is significantly associated with the more advanced stages of the disease. Increased LA dimension and BW, and decreased systolic function are associated with development of AF in dogs with MMVD. Disclosures No disclosures to report.

The LA diameter is usually evaluated on the right parasternal transaortic short-axis view and compared to the aortic (Ao) diameter (LA:Ao ratio). However, LA dilation can develop in medio-lateral, cranio-caudal, or ventro-dorsal directions. Therefore, the LA:Ao ratio may not be reliable for the early detection of LA dilation. Measurements of LA volumes have been recently recommended in the dog using monoplane and biplane Simpson\\'s modified methods of discs (SMOD) and area-length methods (ALM). The objectives of this prospective study were therefore to 1) compare different echocardiographic methods in evaluating LA volume in a large population of CKCs and 2) to assess LA volume according to DMVD severity. The study population consisted in 160 CKCs either healthy or affected by DMVD (median weight = 9.15 kg [interquartile range (IQR) = 7.8-10.3], male-to-female ratio = 0.95). According to the ACVIM classification, 28/160 dogs (17.5%) had no identifiable DMVD lesions (stage A), 86/160 (53.8%) and 22/160 (13.8%) were in stages B1 and B2, respectively, 23/160 (14.3%) had past or current congestive heart failure (CHF, stage C), and 1/160 (0.6%) had refractory CHF (stage D). Dogs for which mitral regurgitation (MR) was adequate for quantification by the Proximal Isovelocity Surface Area method (n = 107) had a median regurgitation fraction (RF) of 38% [23-55]. The monoplane SMOD and ALM using the left apical 4-chamber view overestimated LA volume by comparison with the biplane ALM (+2.6% and + 10.8%, respectively), and the monoplane ALM overestimated LA volume in comparison with the monoplane SMOD (+8.3%). Left atrial volumes significantly increased with ACVIM stages. Among B1 dogs, end-systolic LA volume assessed by the biplane ALM was significantly lower in dogs with mild MR (RF < 30%, median volume = 0.75 mL/kg [IQR = 0.59-0.90]) than for dogs with higher MR (RF≥30%, median volume = 1.39 mL/kg [IQR = 0.96-1.56]; P < 0.01).\\nUn Coeur/Vetoquinol sponsoring for a clinical research assistant position in Alfort Cardiology Unit.

Lagrange Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire d\\'Alfort, Maisons-Alfort, France Intravascular hemolysis has been identified in human patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. The underlying mechanism implies shear stress exerted on erythrocytes by high velocity flows through the stenotic orifice. No similar data are currently available in veterinary medicine. The aim of this prospective study was therefore to 1) document hematological abnormalities in dogs with arterial stenosis (ie, aortic stenosis [AS], pulmonic stenosis [PS]) between 2017 and 2019 and 2) evaluate if maximal and mean Doppler-derived trans-stenotic pressure gradients (ΔP), as well as features of stenotic lesions (number and location), were associated with erythrocyte abnormalities. The study sample consisted of 56 dogs (median age = 1.6 year [interquartile range (IQR) = 0.7-4.0 years], male-to-female ratio = 1.5). The most commonly recruited breeds were French Bulldogs (study population, 44 dogs (79%) had PS and 12 (21%) had AS. The median maximal ΔP values were 161 mmHg [110-215 mmHg] and 144 mmHg [IQR = 125-176 mmHg] for PS and AS, respectively. Included dogs showed 1 (34/56), 2 (16/56) or 3 (6/56) obstructive lesions: subvalvular stenosis for 24/56 dogs (13/44 with PS, 11/12 with AS), valvular stenosis for 42/56 dogs (37/44 with PS, 5/12 with AS), and supravalvular stenosis for 16/56 dog (only PS). Hematological abnormalities were detected in most dogs (n = 49; 88%), with schizocytes found in 28/56 (50%) dogs (median proportion = 1‰ cells [IQR = 0-3‰]), acanthocytes in 46/56 (82%) dogs (median proportion = 45‰ cells [IQR = 10-226‰]), and hemolytic anemia in 4 dogs with PS (hemoglobinemia <12.4 g/dL). No significant association was identified between these abnormalities and the above-mentioned echocardiographic parameters. Three out of the 4 dogs with hemolytic anemia had a maximal ΔP > 200 mmHg (242 to 412 mmHg). Interestingly, the dog with the highest maximal ΔP also had the most severe anemia and schizocytosis, and both abnormalities decreased, and then resolved, after balloon valvuloplasty.\\n(2016-2019) C.

The last echocardiographic examination obtained during sinus rhythm was used to derive selected variables used for successive statistical comparison. For each dog with AF a control dog, matched for body weight (BW), class of heart failure, and LA dimension as expressed by the ratio between LA and aortic diameters (LA:Ao), but never developing AF over a comparable follow up period was selected. All echocardiographic exams were reviewed by a single board certified cardiologist and several variables of LV and LA dimension and function, and LA volumes were obtained. In particular LV internal diameters in diastole and systole were obtained as absolute values and indexed to BW. LA dimensions were expressed as absolute value and LA:Ao, moreover LA volumes were measured during maximal and minimal LA expansion and at the peak of the P wave, and then indexed to BW. Several indexes of LA function were then calculated from these volumes. Peak trans-mitral E and A waves velocities, E:A ratio, and A wave duration were also measured. LA speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) was carried out and peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), peak atrial contraction strain, and contraction strain index were measured.Forty-four dogs with MMVD were included, 22 dogs developing AF and 22 dogs maintaining a sinus rhythm. There was no difference in terms of BW (P = 0.803), sex distribution (P = 0.393), and class of heart failure (P = 0.550). Among the tested echocardiographic variables only LA diameter (P = 0.034), and LV internal diameter in diastole not indexed for BW (P = 0.031) differed significantly between groups. There was no difference in terms of LA:Ao (P = 0.097), LV internal diameters in diastole and systole indexed for BW (P = 0.131 and P = 0.406, respectively), and LA volumes and volume-derived functional parameters. Among the STE-derived variables, PALS values differed significantly between AF group (mean value 23.8 AE 8.6) and control group (mean value 30.5 AE 9.6) (P = 0.027). Absolute cardiac dimensions as well as LA STE, and in particular PALS, are useful echocardiographic predictors for the development of AF in dogs with MMVD.\\nG. Romito 1 , C. Guglielmini 2 , H.

The BoxerClub of Italy (BCI) drafted the guidelines for the \"selection\" of dogs with morphological and attitudinal standards. Given the high prevalence of congenital heart diseases in Boxer dogs the BCI established a cardiovascular screening mandatory for the admission to the selection process. Screening data have been collected by either board-certified cardiologist or operators, selected through a practical exam after a training. During this exam different operators examined the same Boxer and their findings were compared with those of the boardcertified (inter-observer variability) and were compared also three measurements of the same dogs performed by each operator (intraobserver variability). Current reference intervals for aortic annulus dimensions do not account for body weight (BW).The objective of this study is to analyse the aortic annulus dimensions based on sex and BW of dogs.Four thousand two hundred one Boxer dogs free from cardiovascular diseases were included in the study. the analysis due to the lack of data on sex and 119 for the annulus less than 15 mm, remaining for the analysis a sample of 4066 dogs. These dogs have been divided into males and females and into weight quartiles.

Cardiac arrhythmias are observed in patients but studies describing their time course and severity are limited. Cardiac auscultation and short in-hospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) are insensitive for the detection of arrhythmias and as such, many may go undetected.\\nUnsure if this is relevant: Joanne Harris is a director at Heartvets who provide ECG interpretation and Holter rental services. ESVC-P-24 E point to septal separation (EPSS): difference of measurement from the right parasternal long axis and short axis view in dogs C.H. Parmentola 1 , V.A. Patata 2 , F.E. Marchesotti 1 , T.O. of Novara, Novara, Italy, 2 Istituto veterinario of Novara, Novara, Italy E point to septal separation (EPSS) is the distance of the maximal early diastolic motion of the septal mitral valve leaflet (E-point) to the interventricular septum measured using the M-mode recordings. EPSS is an important index in the diagnosis of occult and symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as recently reported in the European screening guidelines for DCM in Doberman Pinschers. EPSS can be measured from the right parasternal long axis view (RPLA) or from the right parasternal short axis view (RPSA). However, no previous studies assessed if the EPSS values are different using different echocardiographic views. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare EPSS values obtained from the RPLA and RPSA views in different canine breeds. This was a prospective observational study. Dogs were presented to the Istituto Veterinario di Novara for routine screening purposes. All dogs underwent a complete clinical and echocardiographic examination performed in right and left lateral recumbency with a simultaneous ECG tracing. The measurement of the EPSS was obtained from both the RPLA and RPSA views. All measurements were performed offline by the same operator (OD) evaluating 3 cardiac cycles, and the mean values were calculated. A total of 33 healthy dogs were included: 20 Golden Retriever, 7 Doberman Pinschers, 3 English Bulldogs, 2 Labrador Retriever and 1 Czechoslovakian Wolf. This study included 27 females and 12 males, with a median age of 3 years (range 1-8 years) and a median body weight of 29.5 kg (range 22-42 kg). The mean EPSS measured from the RPLA and RPSA view were 4.0 AE 0.92 mm and 4.8 AE 1.2 mm\\nTarget case profile: 38 dogs with mitral valve disease who underwent air travel to undergo mitral valve repair at the JASMINE Veterinary Cardiovascular Medical Center between September 2017 and March 2019. Before and after flight events: changes in exercise intolerance, appetite, respiratory rate and frequency of coughing, gastrointestinal signs and presence of syncope were evaluated. Also presence or absence of events related to heart disease post-flying and postoperative discharge rate were studied. All cases boarded the cabin. Thirty-five patients were able to return home (2 dogs without surgery). Two dogs developed events related to mitral valve disease (1 left atrium rupture and 1 pulmonary edema, respectively). The dog with left atrial rupture died before surgery and she did not receive cardiac medications during the flight. The dog that developed pulmonary edema post-flight also missed a dose during the journey, but responded to medical therapy after the landing. Both of the dogs were in ACVIM classification stage D. About 20% of cases showed changes in physical condition (exercise intolerance, appetite) before and after flight. None of the changes required treatment. Two dogs showed gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) before flight. Three patients developed diarrhea after the flight. Among patients who showed respiratory symptoms before and after flight, 38% showed respiratory distress and 19% showed worseing in coughing. There were 5 dogs with syncopal episodes before the flight; however, none of the dogs fainted after the flight. One dog had post-flight syncope.. Although dogs with mitral valve disease may show clinical changes related to air travel, these are only transient and can be alleviated with symptomatic treatment. Post-flight cardiac disease related symptoms can be prevented by managing the medication time with alarm clock or other devices when travelling across timezones. Avoidance of med-ication errors that may be caused by inexperienced while moving and misreading of the clock due to time difference may be sufficient to avert mitral valve disease related events with sufficient alertness. In conclusion, long distance air travel of patients with mitral valve disease can be safely performed by carrying out routine care and medicainfarction (AMI) is the most common cause of human ischemic heart disease. Its pathogenesis involves atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, platelet activation, thrombosis and vasospasms. Only anecdotal information on canine AMI exists. Postmortem descriptions of arteriosclerosis with myocardial ischemic injury and congestive heart failure are available, but clinical data regarding ante-mortem diagnosis of AMI is lacking.

Keiner, N. Bauer, A. Moritz Justus-Liebig-University Gieβen, Gieβen, Germany Reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr) (Siemens ADVIA 2120) is a diagnostic marker of iron deficiency in humans and dogs. RETIC-HGB (IDEXX ProCyte Dx) is a new parameter for analysis of having ILE or not. Low plasma iron or low transferrin saturation (%TfS) in combination with either anaemia and/or altered red blood cell (RBC) indices was required for diagnosis of ILE. Haematologic variables, parameters of iron metabolism as well as serum amyloid A were compared between both groups and correlation between RETIC-HGB and CHr was assessed. RIs for RETIC-HGB and CHr were 12.5-18.0 pg and 14.0-19.9 pg, respectively. In respect of iron and haematologic variables, 20/275 cats (7.3%) were classified as ILE cats. Compared to non-ILE cats, ILE cats had significantly lower median values of RETIC-HGB and CHr. Not unexpectedly, HCT, HGB, MCH, and RBC were significantly decreased in ILE cats. Additionally, ILE cats had significantly increased median SAA values. Correlation between RETIC-HGB and CHr was moderate (r s = 0.59) with a small bias of −1.2 pg. CHr and RETIC-HGB may be suitable early indicators of ILE, especially when used in addition to parameters of iron metabolism. The moderate correlation between RETIC-HGB and CHr is likely due to species and different methodology. Disclosures Disclosures to report. Miriam Keiner: none N.

It can be primary or secondary and it is characterized by anti-RBC antibodies production. IMHA requires a detailed diagnostic pathway as well as a complex therapeutic approach that can include blood transfusion. Unfortunately, IMHA presents a high mortality rate, especially within 15 days after onset. This retrospective study evaluated: a) the clinical and clinicopathological alterations that influenced the choice to perform a blood transfusion in an IMHA patient; b) if blood transfusion could be an additional therapeutic approach; c) application of leukocyte ratios in the prognosis. Sixty-seven cases of IMHA, both primary and secondary, admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital between May 2010 and July 2018, were included. Signalment, history, clinical signs, clinico-pathological parameters and survival rate were collected. Patients were divided in two groups: 44 patients (IMHAnt) treated with immunosuppressive therapy alone (primary n = 36, secondary n = 8) and 23 patients (IMHAt), which received also a blood transfusion (primarily packed RBC) (primary n = 16, secondary n = 6). For all collected parameters, both groups were statistically compared. The IMHAt patients compared to IMHAnt patients (un-regarding to primary or secondary cause) presented: worse marks according to Tokyo Score System (TSS) (Chi Squared, P = 0.003); a lower erythrocyte count (T-test, P = 0.039), hemoglobin concentration (T-test, P = 0.029) and platelet count (Mann-Withney, M-W, P = 0.008); a higher value of band neutrophils (M-W, P = 0.022), band neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (M-W, P = 0.005), (band neutrophil/neutrophil) to lymphocyte ratio (M-W, P = 0.006) and a lower value of lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (M-W, P = 0.013); a higher value of C-reactive protein (M-W, P = 0.011) and activated partial thromboplastin time (M-W, P = 0.014); and a lower survival rate at day 120 (Kaplan-Meyer, logrank, P = 0.004) and not at 7, 15 and 30 days.

In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small, single-stranded non-coding RNAs able to regulate gene expression have been shown to play a critical role in the development and function of immune responses. While in circulation, free-serum miRNAs are highly degradable, when transported in mycelial vesicles (exosomes) they become stable (protected from RNAse degradation) and reliable diagnostic biomarker in diseased patients. In 2013, using murine animal the role played by exosomes and miRNAs was explored during Leishmania infection; a reduction in the activity of miR-122, the most abundant miRNA present in the liver tissue, was obtained. Very little is known about the role of exosomal miRNA in canine leishmaniasis (CL); in particular, the interaction between exosomal miR-122 and lipid alterations. The aim of this study was 3fold: 1) isolate/characterize exosomes in canine serum obtained from 6 healthy dogs; 2) evaluate their quality/quantity of exosomal miR-NAs and proteins; 3) evaluate the expression of serum exosomal miR-122 in 10 healthy dogs and 10 leishmaniotic dogs. Blood samples were collected for routine hematological/biochemical analyses on healthy dogs or before anti-Leishmania therapy. Biochemical panel was completed with a serum cholesterol profile (HDL, LDL). Serum exosomes were isolated using a polymer-based kit and characterized by flow cytometry and electron microscopy. miR-122-5p expression was analyzed via quantitative RT-PCR. Differences between the two groups were statistical analyzed. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. This is the first study showing the detection of circulating serum exosomes content of miR122 in in dogs affected by CL. Serum exosomes of 30-130 nm in diameter containing miR-122 and RNU6-2 miRNAs were isolated. A concentration of 12 ng/μL of miRNAs and 10 μg/μL of proteins were recovered.

Our results suggest that the inter-individual variability of plasma homocysteine concentration in healthy cats may be associated with metabolic peculiarities. Several discriminating amino acids and biogenic amines are involved in pathways of methionine metabolism. Additionally, higher concentrations of plasmalogens in cats with high plasma homocysteine concentration may indicate enhanced oxidative stress or increased activity of protective mechanisms against oxidative stress.\\nAll dogs developed lethargy and gastrointestinal signs within 30 minutes of LPS administration.

School of Alfort, Maisons-Alfort, France, 2 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known acute phase protein in dogs.It has been recently shown to be particularly useful in discriminating bacterial bronchopneumonia from other pulmonary diseases and promising in guiding antibiotic therapy duration. However, in those publications, dogs infected by Bordetella bronchiseptica(Bb) have not been specifically distinguished from others. In an experimental study, high elevations of CRP have been identified in dogs inoculated with Bb. Nevertheless, the amplitude of increase of CRP in naturallyinfected dogs with Bb has not been described.The aim of this study was to describe the values of CRP in dogs with lower airways Bb infection with or without radiographical pulmonary involvement. Magnitude of CRP elevation was also compared with dogs diagnosed with bacterial aspiration bronchopneumonia (ABP).Sixteen dogs with lower airways Bb infection and 36 dogs with ABP were selected. For each included dog, a CRP value and thoracic radiographs at diagnosis were available. Bb infection was radiographs with only one out of 11 dogs having another bacterial coinfection. CRP value was mildly elevated in 11/11 dogs and 1/5 dogs with and without alveolar lesions, respectively (P = 0.002) and the median CRP value was significantly higher in dogs with alveolar lesions compared with dogs without alveolar lesions (20 mg/L,, versus 5 mg/L,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11], P = 0.002). Duration of clinical signs was longer than 2 weeks for all Bb dogs; duration was not different between dogs with normal or elevated value as well as between dogs with or without alveolar lesions. In dogs with Bb infection and alveolar lesions, median CRP value was significantly lower than in dogs with ABP (17 versus 118 mg/L, P < 0.001) and ranges of elevation of CRP did not overlap between these two groups ([15-38 mg/L] and [55-270 mg/L] respectively).\\nS.J. Viitanen, H.P. Laurila, S. Holopainen, M.M. Rajamäki University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Prolonged tissue hypoxia caused by chronic pulmonary disease is commonly cited as an important mechanism in the development of secondary physiologically appropriate polycythemia. However, the prevalence and severity of polycythemia has not been described in detail in dogs with chronic hypoxic pulmonary disease. 44 dogs (median age 11.9, interquartile range 10.0-13.3 years) with chronic pulmonary disease and documented chronic hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO 2 ] <80 mmHg on at least two separate arterial blood gas measurements minimum of 1 month apart) were retrospectively identified from patient records. Dogs of sight hound breeds were excluded. The diagnosis was based on thorough clinical examinations including bronchoscopy and brochoalveolar lavage, thoracic computed tomography, lung histopathology or a combination of the aforementioned. Statistical correlation between PaO 2 and red blood cell parameters was analyzed using Pearson\\'s correlation coefficients. The group comprised of 23 West Highland white terriers with canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 21 dogs of other breeds with the following lung diseases; chronic bronchitis 13/2142/44 dogs (mean 173 AE STD 21 g/L, range 121-221 g/L, laboratory reference range 140-203 g/L) and hematocrit (Hkr) was normal in 39/44 dogs (mean 51.0 AE STD 5.7%, range 35-64%, laboratory reference range 38-57%). Marked polycythemia (hematocrit ≥65%) was not noted in any of the dogs. Red blood cell parameters were not correlated with the severity of hypoxia (correlation to PaO 2 : Erytr r = −0.054, P = 0.728; Hb r = −0.141, P = 0.360; Hkr r = −0.99, P = 0.521).These results indicate that polycythemia is uncommonly encountered in dogs with chronic hypoxic pulmonary disease and when encountered, only mild increases in red blood cell parameters are noted.DisclosuresDisclosures to report.S.J.

Feline blood has a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate; therefore, if the syringe containing collected blood is placed upright, plasma can be removed from the red cells shortly after collection for separate storage of plasma and PRBCs. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of feline PRBC units obtained by blood sedimentation both at collection and after storage for 42 days.Blood was collected from fourteen feline blood donors into three 20 mL syringes pre-charged with CPDA-1:blood ratio of 1:7 using an open system. A pre-donation CBC was performed in each donor. The three syringes were allowed to sediment for approx. 1 hour at room temperature. Then plasma was aseptically expressed ; II) percentage hemolysis; III) morphological index (only for PRBC units), scored of 0 to 3 based on echinocyte transformation of the normal discocyte; IV) aerobic and anaerobic blood culture (only for PRBC units).From donor to PRBC units there was a significant increase in RBC count (mean increase +1886 AE SD1399 μL/10 3 ), Hb concentration (+2.8 AE 2.2 g/dL), Hct percentage (+8.3 AE 5.5%). Significant reduction was found in PLT count (−249 AE 189 μL/10 3 ). Comparing PRBC at D0 and D42 a significant increase was found in percentage hemolysis (+ 1.2%), morphological index (+ 0.9) and a significant reduction in RBC count (−460 AE 679 μL/10 3 ), Hct percentage (−3.2 AE 3.5%), WBC count (median − 2589 μL/10 3 ), and PLT count (median − 43 μL/10). All blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.PRBC units obtained by sedimentation of donated blood appear to be a suitable blood component for treatment of normovolemic anemia.However storage for 42 days, as suggested for canine and feline PRBC units, resulted in significant hematological changes that could reduce oxygen delivery after transfusion.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESVIM-P-21Bronchoscopic findings in dogs with bronchial vegetal foreign bodies: a retrospective study of 52 cases(2010-2019) J. Flageollet, L. Poujol, C. Peyron, S. Gibert, A. Dunié-Merigot, L. Blond, F. Bernardin Centre Hospitalier Vétérinaire Languedocia, Montpellier, France Vegetal foreign bodies are a frequent cause of cough in dogs during spring and summer in France. They can result in a variety of other clinical signs and endoscopic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to describe the foreign body location, rate of retrieval success, complications, and macroscopic endoscopic findings in dogs with vegetal foreign bodies. Fifty two dogs were included in this retrospective evaluation from the medical records of dogs admitted between 2010 and 2019 for a bronchial vegetal foreign body. Diagnosis was based on direct visualisation during the bronchoscopic exam or after surgical retrieval. 27 males and 25 females were included in this study. More than half were hunting dogs (29/52). Duration of clinical signs ranged from 1 to 1400 days. Cough was the main clinical sign (49/52). Foreign bodies were removed from a right-sided bronchus in 35/52 (67%) cases, from a left-sided bronchus in 11/52 (21%) cases, from both right and left bronchi in 6/52 (12%) cases. Endoscopic retrieval was successful in 43 of 52 cases (83%). Nine dogs needed a surgical treatment. The sur-study confirm the safety and usefulness of bronchoscopy in diagnosis and treatment of bronchial vegetal foreign bodies in dogs. Mucosal nodules associated with purulent material within the airways are frequent endoscopic findings. Disclosures No disclosures to report.

Clercx 1 1 University of Liege, Liege, Belgium, 2 Department of Food Sciences -Microbiology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium Dolichocephalic breeds are predisposed to sinonasal aspergillosis while brachycephalic dogs are not affected. Since disruptions in the resident microbiome may contribute to disease pathogenesis by modulating immune responses and since microbiota dictates the type of host-fungus relationship, we hypothetized that differences in predisposition to nasal disease in dogs could be associated with differences in core nasal microbiota between breeds. Fourty-six healthy dogs were recruited, including 22 medium to large dogs from dolichocephalic breeds (DC), 12 brachycephalic dogs (BC) and 12 terrier dogs (T). All dogs were older than 14 months. Dogs were living either in rural (n = 21) or urban domestic conditions (n = 25). Nasal swabs were obtained under anesthesia and banked at −80 C until batched analysis. After DNA extraction, a PCR targeting the V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA was performed. Amplicons were then sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina sequencer. Taxonomical assignation and microbiota community analysis were done with MOTHUR V1.41.0 with an OTU clustering distance of 0.03.\\nScienze Veterinarie, Grugliasco, Italy, 2 Endovet Freelance Group, Italy Sino-nasal aspergillosis (SNA) is an important cause of chronic nasal disease in the dog, characterized by the formation of a superficial mucosal fungal plaque within the nasal cavity and/or frontal sinus of systemically healthy dogs. Aspergillus fumigatus is classically recognized as the most important etiological agent. Notably, this species is now considered a \"group\" (the Fumigati group) including several species distinguishable only via molecular exams. To date, few studies have analyzed fungal isolates involved in canine SNA cases at genetic level, showing that A. fumigatus sensu stricto was the main causal species. On the opposite, other species of the Fumigati group (the so called criptic species of the viridinutans complex) have been found associated to SNA in cats (in cats SNA is more invasive and has a poor prognosis, due to the involvement of the retro-orbital space). The aim of this study was to described the clinical and mycological features of a series of 38 cases of canine SNA in Italy. Cases were recruited by veterinarians belonging to ENDOVET (a group specialized in endoscopy). The diagnosis was achieved by a combination of exams (endoscopic visualization of fungal plaques and/or visualization of fungal elements at cytology/histology of nasal biopsies). Fungi were isolated from biopsies and identified by morphological keys and molecular analyses (sequencing of the ß-tubulin gene). Twenty isolates chosen randomly were tested in vitro against some antifungal agents commonly used in the dog with SNA (itraconazole, clotrimazole, enilconazole) and other agents more used in human patients (voriconazole, posaconazole\\nrole of vector-borne diseases in the aetiology of overt canine proteinuria: a retrospective study in 106 dogs M.L.Q.M.

Lippi University of pisa, Pisa, Italy Impairment in antioxidant enzyme activity is involved in several complications in human patients managed with intermittent haemodialysis (HD). Different factors, concerning uraemia and HD treatment, can promote oxidative stress in these patients. HD may generate oxidative stress due to several factors, such as reduced dialyzer biocompatibility, extensive contact between blood and synthetic surfaces of extracorporeal circuit, and poor dialysate sterility. The aim of the present study was to evaluate antioxidant enzyme activity between pre-and post-haemodialysis treatment in dogs with acute uraemia, and its correlation with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Ten uremic dogs managed with HD (HDG) and ten clinically healthy dogs (CG) were included. Enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were assessed in blood hemolysates of dogs of both groups. In HDG dogs, blood samples were taken immediately before HD, and at the end of HD (15 seconds into bypass at standard blood flow of 50 mL/min). HDG dogs were classified according to IRIS guidelines for AKI. The presence of SIRS and DIC were diagnosed on the basis of emathological, biochemical and coagulation profile according to the recently published criteria. Enzymatic activities of CAT, SOD and GPx were compared among CG, pre HD treatment (n = 17) and post HD treatment (n = 17), using the Tukey\\'s Multiple Comparison Test. Enzymatic activities of CAT, SOD and GPx showed no significant differences between pre-dialysis and post-dialysis values,\\nDogs presented to the University of Extremadura veterinary hospital with a variety of clinical signs and diagnosed with visceral Leishmaniasis were included in the study and 5 groups were stablished: 10 healthy dogs (C),13 dogs with an urinary protein/creatinine ratio or UP/C ≤ 0.2 and plasma creatinine or CR < 1.4 mg/dL (G1),7 dogs presenting UP/C 0.21-0.4 and CR < 1.4 mg/dL (G2),16 dogs with UP/C ≥ 0.41 and CR < 1.4 mg/dL (G3) and 16 dogs with UP/C ≥ 0.41 and CR≥1.4 mg/dL (G4).Some dogs also had other testing including thoracic radiographs, echocardiography or Leishmania PCR in a variety of tissues.\\nhighest sensibility versus Cefovecin (70%), Marbofloxacin (67.2%), Trimetoprim/Sulphamide (64.3%), Ceftriaxone (63.5%), Pradofloxacin (61.5%) and Enrofloxacin (60.9%).

Of the 68 dogs underwent to abdominal ultrasound, 58 (85.3%) showed ultrasonographic abnormalities involving the urinary system: 36 (52.9%) in the upper tract, 41 (60.3%) in the lower tract and 19 of these in both (27.9%).\\n43 C) combined with radiotherapy (HT-RT), or thermoradiotherapy, is used clinically in particular cases of human and canine cancer. Hyperthermia provokes changes at different levels: in the tumor microenvironment by increasing perfusion and oxygenation and inducing an immune response, in the tumor cells by induction of cell death and inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms. These changes increase the efficacy of radiation treatment towards a better tumor response. However, the molecular mechanisms of this cellular sensitization have not been fully elucidated. The aims of our study were firstly to screen human and canine cancer cell lines for their sensitivity towards hyperthermia-radiotherapy treatment, and investigate the role of heat-shock protein HSP70, and DNA repair proteins in the radiosensitization mechanism. Survival curves after treatment were determined in a panel of human and canine cancer cell lines using a clonogenic survival assay. We analyzed the effect of HT-RT on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Further, we tested the influence of the HT-RT time gap, different temperatures and order of the treatment, using A549 cells that are sensitized by hyperthermia as positive controls. Levels of HSP70 and the DNA repair protein RAD51 were analyzed in HT-sensitive and -resistant cell lines by Western-Blot. Knockdown of HSP70 was performed in A549 cells using siRNA against HSP70. Additionally, we evaluated mRNA levels of BRCA2 in an ex vivo canine tumor model (soft tissue sarcomas, carcinomas, mast cell tumors), and whether they were affected by hyperthermia. Out of eight cell lines tested, only A549 and Abrams cells showed significant decrease in clonogenic cell survival when pre-treated with hyperthermia at 42 C.\\nhas been financially supported by Royal Canin SAS (Mars Petcare).

Although direct transmission of B. gibsoni between fighting dogs has been reported from the USA, Korea and Romania, this mode of transmission does not occur in Taiwan. The objective of our study was to correlate the distribution of Babesia with the distribution of ticks infesting dogs in Taiwan. A total of 389 surplus blood samples and 3037 ticks were collected from 389 roaming and free ranging owned dogs, during neutering procedures, at various residential sites in Taiwan between January 2014 and December 2017. The prevalence of B. gibsoni and B. in the middle and 45 dogs from the south of Taiwan. Five different species of ticks were found: Rhipicephalus sanguineus (throughout Taiwan), Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides (only in the north), Haemaphysalis hystricis (only in the north and middle of Taiwan), Amblyomma testidunarium and Ixodes ovatus (both only in the north). The prevalence of B. gibsoni and B. vogeli infection was 13.4% (56/389) and 10.3% (40/389), respectively. Most positive B. gibsoni dogs were found in the northern part of the country 51/56 (91%), whereas a few were found in the middle part 5/56 (9%). Babesia vogeli infections were distributed as follows: 29/40 (72.5%) in the north, 3/40 (7.5%) in the middle and 8/40 (20%) in the south of the country. None of the dogs in the south were infected with B gibsoni, which correlated with the absence of H. hystricis, a tick recently identified as the local vector for B gibsoni. Babesia vogeli was more equally distributed coinciding with the occurrence of R.sanguineus, which tick is present throughout Taiwan.

Sarpataki, A.R. Codea, I. Marcus, M. Cenariu, E. Pall, B. Sevastre Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania Feline immunodeficiency virus (FiV) is one the most common infectious agents of cats. FIV is a lentivirus that shares many properties with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can cause an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) due to gradual loss in T helper cell numbers and function, characterized by increased susceptibility to secondary pathogens. Both viruses preferentially infect CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to an inversion of the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio. Tenofovir, a Nucleotide Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor, is effective against FIV in vitro, and there is some evidence that tenovovir might have greater anti-FIV efficacy with less cytotoxicity than other antiretroviral compounds.\\nSanté Animale, Libourne, France, 2 University of Life Science, Lublin, Poland, 3 Auburn University, Auburn, United States of America, 4 Paster Institute, Paris, France, 5 Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands, 6 University of Rhode Island, Kingston, United States of America Canine Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a disease common and well-documented in the northeastern and midwestern parts of the USA, while in Europe the clinical presentation and the existence of the disease are controversially discussed. Fever and arthritis are clinical manifestations most often associated with LB; other presentations such as renal, cardiac, neurological, and muscular disorders are suspected to be sequelae of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) infection, but were not reproduced experimentally. The aim of this study was to document various presentations of canine LB in North America and Europe. Twenty-nine dogs were included in this retrospective study based on clinical signs consistent with LB and at least positive antibody detection. Nineteen dogs lived in endemic areas in the USA, while 10 dogs resided in Europe. Medical records were available for 28 cases, and a phone contact with the owner and the attending veterinarian was established for the 29th case.\\n(Mhc) and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum (CMhp) are two species of canine hemoplasma that may cause hemolytic anemia and chronic disease in canine species. While understanding is limited, blood transfusions, bloodsucking arthropods, biting and fighting are suspected routes of hemoplasma transmission in dogs. The aim of the present survey was to determine the prevalence of hemotropic mycoplasma infections in hunting dogs from Southern Italy and assess related risk factors. Blood samples were collected from 1433 hunting dogs in the Napoli, Avellino and Salerno provinces of Campania region of Southern Italy, and tested by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for amplification of Mhc and CMhp DNA. The dogs had no clinical signs at the time of sampling. The overall PCR positive rates were13.1% for Mhc and 11.4% for CMhp. Coinfection with both hemoplasma species was found in 4% of animals. Statistical analysis revealed living in Salerno province (Mhc: OR = 2.94, 95% CI: 2.10-4.11; CMhp: OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.61-3.20), hound breeds (Mhc: OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 2.86-5.59; CMhp: OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.16-2.24), pack size more than 10 animals (Mhc: OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14-2.47; CMhp: OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.06-2.44) and wild mammals hunting (Mhc: OR = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.51-4.98; CMhp: OR = 15.7, 95% CI: 8.83-28.0) as associated risk factors for both canine hemoplasma infection. Adult age was a variable significantly associated only to infection by CMhp (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.25-2.97). To the authors\\' knowledge, this is the first large-scale molecular survey on Mhc and CMhp infections in dogs living in Southern Italy. The obtained data confirm the circulation of these two species of canine hemoplasma within the hunting dog population of Southern Italy, although their pathogenic potential and the possible epidemiological relationships between hunting dogs and sympatric wild animal populations are still unclear.

Olds Iowa State University, Ames, United States of America Though the role of cats as a reservoir for B. henselae has long been established, the prevalence of infection or exposure of cats to other Bartonella species or to other vector-borne diseases remains unreported. Using serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prevalence of exposure and bacteremia of vector-borne infections (Anaplasmaspp, Babesiaspp, Cytauxzoonspp, Ehrlichiaspp, Rickettsiaspp, Piroplasma,Mycoplasmaspp, and Bartonellaspp.) was assessed in a population of free-roaming cats in a rural area of the Midwestern United States. Serum and EDTA blood samples were collected from 65 freeroaming cats captured as part of a community spay and neuter program. Testing with PCR revealed that 9 cats (14%) were positive for Bartonella species (6 for B. henselaeand 3 for B. clarridgeiae) and 7 cats (11%) were positive for Mycoplasma species (6 for M. haemominutim and 1 for M. haemofelis). Serological testing revealed that 50 cats (83%) were positive for antibodies against Bartonella species. More specifically, 50 cats were positive for B. koehlerae, 47 were positive for B. henselae and 42 were positive for B. vinsonii subspecies berkhoffi. A significant positive correlation was identified between positive Bartonella spp. PCR results and the presence of antibodies against B. vinsonii berkhoffi and B. henselae. All cats that were positive for Bartonella by PCR had positive serologies for all three species of Bartonella tested. Odds ratio analysis of age, sex and weight revealed that male cats were at increased risk for exposure to B. vinsonii berkhoffi. Disclosures Disclosures to report.

In this 13-year single-centre cross-sectional study, CT reports of dogs underwent thoracic CT examination for various reasons were reviewed. Patients\\' characteristics were assessed for likely associations with RAA. Radiographic and echocardiographic studies were also evaluated when available. Continuous data were assessed for normality of distribution with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Dogs with RAA were compared with dogs without RAA for the variable gender and sexual status using Chi-Square test. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to analyse age and body weight of groups. The body condition score (five points scoring system) was analyzed using the Fischer\\'s exact test. Nonnormally distributed data were reported as median, interquartile range (IQR), and range. For all statistical analyses, the significance level was set to α = 0.05. CT data of dogs with RAA were retrieved from archive and analyzed using various post-processing techniques. RAA location and shape were recorded. Oblique multiplanar views were used such that the area to be measured was orthogonal to the long axis of the RAA. RAA measurements included the neck, maximum height and width. Additional CT features of cardiac and extracardiac structures were also recorded. RAA was detected in 23/10886 dogs having thoracic CT in the selected period of time (0.21% prevalence). Radiographic and echocardiographic studies were available for 10/23 dogs.A mediastinal mass were visible in 2/10 radiographs. Echocardiographic examination disclosed RAA in 4/10 dogs with pulmonary hypertension. The bodyweights of dogs with RAA were significantly lower than those of the remaining 10 836 dogs without RAA (median 8 kg [IQR 5; range 37.6] and median 16 kg[IQR 23; range 116.9]    respectively; P = 0.003). Female sex was also significantly associated with RAA (P = 0.03). Four/23 dogs had also right atrial dilatation.Three different RAA phenotypes were detected: sack-like in 19/23 dogs, focal lump-like in 3/23 dogs, and fusiform in 1/23 dog. Results of CT measurements were: mean of the neck 1.48 cm [IQR 1; range 2.6]; mean height 3.06 cm [IQR 1.39; range 4.85], and mean width 1.64 cm [IQR 1; range 3.1]. RAA is an infrequent (0.21%) and often incidental condition that can have different phenotypes. In this study, female sex and smaller size showed an association with RAA. Further case-control studies are necessary to assess a possible relationship between RAA and pulmonary hypertension.\\nA. Franchini 1 , J. Abbott 1 , B. Tyrrell 2 , S. Rosenthal 2 , S. Lahmers 1 , G.

Congestive signs were defined as tachypnea, dyspnea and cough that resolved with medical treatment for HF. Medical records of 5122 dogs enrolled in the LOOK-Mitral registry from 1st November 2015 to 31st July 2018 were reviewed to identify dogs with stable ACVIM-Stage C MMVD defined as dogs with CS and unchanged medical treatment for at least four weeks since the first identification of HF. The study population was composed by 186 dogs, subsequently divided into two groups: reoccurrence group (RG, n = 66) and no reoccurrence group (NRG, n = 120). Reoccurrence of CS was defined by resting respiratory rate > 40 breath/minute and/or dyspnea, within the study period, that resolved after furosemide increase. Baseline body weight (BW) (OR:1.11, 90%CI:1.06-1.17), presence of cough (OR:1.98, 90%CI:1.05-3.74), left atrial-aortic ratio (LA/Ao)(OR: 3.08, 90%CI:1.38-6.86), left ventricular internal diameter at enddiastole (OR: 3.41, 90%CI:1.22-9.50) and end-systole (OR: 7.61, 90% CI:2.32-24.90) indexed to body size, mitral valve peak E wave velocity(OR: 3.44, 90%CI:1.63-7.27), and furosemide daily dosage (OR:1.32, 90%CI:1.04-1.67) were associated with reoccurrence of CS in the univariate analysis. The BW (P = 0.0003) and LA/Ao (P = 0.0196) remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Increment of 0.1 of LA/Ao or of 1 kg in body weight were both associated with 1.1 increased odds of reoccurrence.This study suggests that BW and LA/Ao are independent predictors of reoccurrence of CS in dogs with stable ACVIM-Stage C MMVD.Disclosures to report.Dr. Michele Borgarelli receives financial support from Ceva Sante Animale for studies unrelated to this Abstract.Dr. Alessandra Franchini receives finical support form Ceva Sante Animale for her PhD.\\nAll the study was funded by Affinity Petcare SA.

Using the US IDEXX Reference Laboratories database 2, 395 cats were identified with samples that were tested with TT4, SDMA and Cr. From this dataset, a hyperthyroid treated group was identified, from this treated population a total of 479 subnormal TT4 cats were identified, defined as having a TT4 < 0.8 μg/dL post hyperthyroid treatment. The remaining cats were euthyroid after treatment. A four-to-one comparative age-matched control group of post treatment euthyroid cats to subnormal TT4 cats was used to evaluate SDMA and Cr pre-and post-treatment. A McNemar\\'s paired test or Chi-square test was used where appropriate. A significant increase in the number of subnormal TT4 cats with an SDMA concentration above the reference interval was found compared to euthyroid controls post-treatment (39.6% (190/479)    vs. 32.1% (616/1916), P < 0.001). Cr concentrations were also increased above the reference interval in a significantly greater number of subnormal TT4 cats as compared to controls post-treatment (25.9% (124/479) vs. 12.8% (246/1916), P < 0.001). In the subnormal TT4 group increased SDMA concentrations identified 13.7% more cats with potential decrease in GFR and reduction in renal function than Cr. This study confirms that a significant percentage of cats with subnormal TT4 attributed to overtreatment of hyperthyroidism have abnormal renal biomarkers as compared to those that are euthyroid following therapy. The big data used for this study supports the importance of avoiding iatrogenic hypothyroidism. The identified association of reduced renal function with iatrogenic hypothyroidism emphasizes the importance of avoiding overtreatment. Comprehensive renal monitoring including measurement of SDMA should be part of routine management of hyperthyroid cats.All authors listed are employed full-time for IDEXX laboratories.Prevalence of \\'Atypical\\' Addison\\'s disease among a population of dogs diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism D.

Ollier 2 , B. Catchpole 3 , L.J. Kennedy 2 Royal Veterinary College, University of London, London, United Kingdom, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 3 Royal Veterinary College, London, United Kingdom Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) can be classified as insulin resistance or insulin deficiency diabetes, with all cases requiring daily insulin injections to control hyperglycaemia. A number of pathological mechanisms are thought to lead to the development of the disease, including immune-mediated destruction of beta cells. Disease risk differs considerably between breeds, suggesting that genetic factors are involved, but environmental triggers are also thought to play a role. In human Type 1 DM, the region of the genome containing the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) MHC class II genes confers approximately 50% of the genetic risk. Associations with dog leucocyte antigen(DLA) class II haplotypes have also been identified in diabetic dogs, but investigations to date have considered all breeds together. This study aimed to identify breed-specific diabetes-associated DLA haplotypes in an expanded data set. Taking the 18 most highly represented breeds in our previous study, we increased the DLA-typing data from 294 to 736 diabetic dogs and from 501 to 1083 breed-matched nondiabetic controls to enable breed-specific statistical analysis.Dogs were genotyped for DLA-DRB1, −DQA1 and -DQB1 using sequence-based typing of DNA (extracted from blood surplus to diagnostic requirements). The study population only included dogs from the UK.

Scattered case reports show varied clinical consequences of hereditary methemoglobinemia in dogs. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the metabolic and molecular bases and characterize clinicopathological features of canine CYB5R deficiency. Twenty-five dogs from various breeds were investigated for unexplained mild to severe non-cardiopulmonary cyanosis. EDTA blood was used to determine methemoglobin concentrations (methb%) and CYB5R enzyme activities, and analyze CYB5R3 gene for diseasecausing mutations. The previously documented nonsynonymous Ile190Leu CYB5R3 variant was homozygous in 16 of the dogs and heterozygous in 3 dogs. The other previously identified variant was not found in any other dogs. Whole genome sequencing analysis identified 2 novel nonsynonymous CYB5R3 variants: Arg219Pro (homozygous in 7 dogs) and Thr202Ala (homozygous in 1 dog).The mean methb% was 23.8% (AE11.5 [SD]) and median CYB5R activity was 10.9% (Q1, Q3;5.8,24.1).

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (3CG) and carbapenemaseproducing (CP) Enterobacteriaceae are of particular importance as their easily transmitted resistance genes mediate resistance to many antimicrobial classes. The aims of this study were: to assess the prevalence of MDRO carriage in dogs and cats at presentation to veterinary clinics/practices, to monitor MDRO acquisition during hospitalization, to study MDRO transmission among pets and owners and to determine the duration of carriage. For this prospective, longitudinal, observational study, rectal and nasal/ oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 88 cats and 183 dogs presented to 5 veterinary care facilities and 187/271 animals were resampled at discharge. Participating owners sampled themselves (nasal swab/stool sample). Carriers were resampled for up to 8 months. Nasal/ oropharyngeal swabs were analysed for the presence of methicillinresistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MR S. pseudintermedius (MRSP), MR coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), MR Macrococcus spp. and rectal swabs/stool for ESBL-producing and CP Enterobacteriaceae. After enrichment, isolates were selected on CHROMID ESBL, OXA-48 and CARBA plates or MRSA selective agar. Isolates were identified via MALDI-TOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by measurement of MICs and clonality determined using rep-PCR, ERIC-PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS).The overall admission prevalence of MDRO carriage was 15.5%) with ESBL-producing E.coli (5.5%) and MRCoNS (8.5%) predominating. The overall discharge prevalence was 32.6% (95%CI 26-39.8; range 17.2-42.7%). In the institution with the highest discharge prevalence predominant hospital-acquired isolates were: ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (13.7%) and ESBL-producing E.coli (16.7%).

It was hypothesized that dogs with AE had significantly different concentrations of [25(OH)D 3 ] compared to healthy dogs while similar concentrations to dogs with CE.The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Twenty-eight client owned adult dogs were recruited prospectively. Ten healthy, 10 diagnosed with AE (clinical signs <72 hours) and 8 diagnosed with CE (clinical signs >3 weeks).

All cats presented dyspnea related to CHF (pleural effusion [4/17], pulmonary edema [6/17] or both [7/17]), associated with ascites in 2/17 cats. The cause of CHF was determined in all cats by echocardiography: hypertrophic (8/17,47%), restrictive (3/17,18%), dilated (3/17,18%) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular (2/17,12%) cardiomyopathy, and aortic valve congenital abnormality (1/17,5%). The left atrium (LA) was dilated in all cats, with a median end-diastolic LA-to-aorta-ratio of 1.97 [IQR = 1.80-2.11, normal values <1.2]. Median torasemide dosage at initiation was 0.20 mg/kg/day [IQR = 0.17-0.23]. Follow-up was available for all cats. Torasemide dosage was increased for 41% (7/17) cats due to the persistence of CHF signs (median time from treatment initiation to dosage change = 7 days [7-32]; median dosage = 0.26 mg/kg/day [0.19-0.34]). Additionally, furosemide was added 12 hours after torasemide intake for 29% (5/17) of cats (median time from treatment initiation to furosemide initiation = 15 days [1-44]; median dosage = 1.13 mg/kg/day [1.09-1.35]). Other treatments included benazepril (4/17), pimobendane (4/17), clopidogrel (12/17), aspirin (3/17) and spironolactone (3/17). Regression of clinical signs was observed in most cats (16/17), with no remarkable adverse events. Death was reported in 8/17 cats, with 6/8 euthanized as a result of CHF worsening (n = 4) or aortic thromboembolism (n = 2), and death related to CHF for 2/8 cats.

After admission dogs with IMHA with and without pancreatitis had a 7-day follow-up. If some of the dogs with IMHA without pancreatitis developed pancreatitis, they switched to the IMHA with pancreatitis group and were followed-up for 7 days after the pancreatitis event. Free plasma hemoglobin (Hb fp ) for dogs with IMHA with pancreatitis (at the time of pancreatitis diagnosis) and without pancreatitis (at presentation) was calculated (Hb fp = Hb tot -[RBC x CHCM x MCV]/1000) and compared (Mann-Whitney test). ROC curve analysis was used to identify the best Hb fp cutoff value (Youden index) discriminating IMHA dogs with and without pancreatitis. Relative Risk (RR) of developing pancreatitis in dogs with IMHA and Hb fp concentration ≥ the Youden Index, was calculated.

In vitro MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) values were within expected limits, therefore resistance was not detected. A breed predisposition was not noted. On the contrary, in agreement with some past studies, a sex predisposition could be noted, since males accounted for 66% of the sample. Clinical signs more frequently observed are those already reported in the literature (eg. nasal discharge was present in 100% of the cases, it was monolateral in 82%).Frontal sinus involvement was confirmed in 47% of cases. Although data on follow up visits were incomplete, the most effective treatment seemed to be represented by mechanical debridement of fungal plaques plus local treatment using clotrimazole cream or enilconazole solution (procedures conducted during endoscopy).No disclosures to report.Uroliths in dogs fromEurope and China -a comparative study D. Breu, C. Wenk, E. Müller LABOKLIN, Bad Kissingen, Germany Our study aimed to evaluate and compare the nature of canine uroliths. The study involved 4204 dogs from predominantly Central Europe (CE) and 830 dogs from China (CN) during the year 2016-2018. Analyses were performed using infrared spectroscopy. The global statistics of uroliths in CE:CN dogs were male (40%:45%), female (24%:31%), neutered (18%:15%) and spayed dogs (17%:9%). The population of CE:CN dogs consisted of 511:71 mongrels and 163:45 breeds. The uroliths comprised struvite (CE:CN = 43.3%:48.3%), calcium oxalate (33.2%:41%), cystine (13.3%:4.8%), ammonium urate (5.1%:1.9%) and others (<5%). The CE:CN dogs had median ages (years): struvite (7:6), calcium oxalate (9:8), and cystine (5:3). Struvite uroliths in CE:CN dogs accounted for: females (81%:81%), spayed (79.5%:74.4%), males (17%:33.9%) and neutered dogs (17%:26.5%).Calcium oxalate uroliths in CE:CN dogs were: males (43.5%:46.6%), neutered (53.6%:42.8%), females (15%:15%) and spayed dogs (15%:15%).Cystine uroliths in CE:CN dogs accounted for: males (28.6%:9.1%),In CE cohorts, cystine uroliths were present in 11/13(=84.6%) of Irish terriers, a breed reported to have a genetic predisposition to cystine calculi.

With receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis the ideal cut-off value was determined to be 0.37, below which the tubular proteinuria could be identified with high confidence (sensitivity = 93.75%, specificity = 75.0%, positive predictive value = 82.35%, negative predictive value = 81.81%).Using this cut-off value, tubular proteinuria was diagnosed in 10 dogs (35.71%) and non-tubular proteinuria in 17 animals (60.71%). The uAPR results showed a high correlation with the electrophoresis outcomes. There was only one dog with a false negative result (\\'tubular\\' on uAPR and \\'non-tubular\\' on electrophoresis), and 3 dogs had false positive results (\\'non-tubular\\' on uAPR and normal protein excretion pattern on electrophoresis).\\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the activity of the N-acetil-β-Dglucozaminidase (NAG) index as an early tubular damage marker in neutered male cats with obstructive FLUTD. 57 male cats of different breeds and ages, diagnosed with obstructive lower urinary tract disease were included in this study. Diagnosis was based on physical examination, haematological, biochemical, radiological and ultrasound exam.Urine specimens collected via cystocentesis were subjected to complete urinary analysis (urinary biochemistry, urinary sediment, and culture and sensitivity tests). Complementary, urinary NAG index activity was evaluated in these samples.Higher values of urinary NAG index were found in male cats with obstructive FLUTD and bacterial implication (median value of 55,52 AE 12,3 U/g) when compared with aseptic obstructive FLUTD were median NAG index values were found to be 33,12 AE 14,8 U/g. Prolonged anuria consecutive to uretral obstruction as well as repeated obstructive episodes induces kidney tubular lesions. The use of this marker in current medical practice allows early diagnosis of patients with tubular damage consecutive to urethral obstruction and urinary reflux. Obstructed male cats with UTI have a greater risk of developing tubular lesions especially those with septic cystitis.\\nS. Pagnamenta 1 , D. Gonin Jmaa 2 , M. Wenger 3 , B.

Furthermore, vesicoureteral reflux was found to be associated with urinary tract infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of bacteriuria in young Boxer dogs and to describe changes in the urine composition of these dogs.In 165 clinically healthy Boxer puppies, urine was collected by cystocentesis. Urinalysis including urine culture was performed.Dogs were examined at the age of 48 to 106 days (median 61 days).There were 22 male and 143 female dogs. Culture was positive in 36 female dogs (25% of the female dogs). None of the male dogs had a positive culture. Of the cultured bacteria, 82% were E. coli. Pyuria was seen in 52% of the culture positive dogs and in 4% of the culture negative dogs. Bacteria in the sediment were seen in 75% of the culture positive dogs and in 5% of the culture negative dogs. The combination of pyuria and bacteria in the sediment was seen in 42% of the culture positive dogs and in 2% of the culture negative dogs. Urine specific gravity ranged from 1.005 to 1.051 (median 1.034) and was significantly lower in culture positive dogs compared to culture negative dogs (median 1.024 vs. 1.037).Bacterial colonization of the urine is common in young female Boxer dogs. The significance of this finding specifically concerning a possible association to the development of kidney disease has to be determined.Disclosures to report.

Pierini, I. Lippi, V. Meucci, F. Battaglia, F. Perondi, V. Marchetti University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a sensitive renal biomarker whose concentrations increase earlier than creatinine as glomerular filtration rate decreases. So far in humans, SDMA is considered an important early biomarker of kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate SDMA in dogs with acute pancreatitis (AP) and their association with kidney injury and severity of disease. Dogs with AP, presented at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of University of Pisa between 2017 and 2019, were prospectively enrolled. AP diagnosis was based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test (Idexx Laboratories) and positive abdominal ultrasound within 48 h from admission. Dogs with a history of renal diseases (clinical records/history, bloodwork and diagnostic imaging), urinary tract infection and/or on hemodialysis treatment were excluded, along with dogs that had received known nephrotoxic drugs (eg. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides).For each dog, data about urea, creatinine and urinary output (UO) were recorded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) grading was made based on current IRIS consensus. Canine Acute Pancreatitis Severity (CAPS) was calculated for each dog at presentation and previously described cut-off of 11 was used to divide dog into two groups (CAPS < and > 11). SDMA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SDMA was compared between UO groups (O, NO), presence of AKI and with CAPS score groups using Mann-Whitney U-test or Welch\\'s t-test based on normality distribution. SDMA was correlated with urea and creatinine levels using Spearman\\'s correlation test.Fifty-one dogs with diagnosis of AP were enrolled with owners\\' informed consent. Sixteen dogs showed AKI and 11 of them were oligo-anuric. Overall median SDMA was 13.8 mg/dL (range 0.6-65 mg/dL). Twenty-three dogs (45%), of which 13 in non-AKI group, had SDMA above reference range (15 mg/dL). Median SDMA was significantly higher in AKI dogs (18.5 vs. 12.4 mg/dL; P = 0.01).Both urea and creatinine concentration showed a positive correlation with SDMA level in AKI dogs (P = 0.01 r = 0.6 and P = 0.006 r = 0.7, respectively) but the same correlations were not significant in non-AKI group. No association between SDMA and UO was found. Finally, dogs with CAPS>11 had higher SDMA compared to dogs with CAPS<11 (26.9 AE 5 mg/dL vs. 13.8 AE 1.5 mg/dL, P = 0.03). Based on our results, SDMA seems to be associated with disease severity (CAPS).SDMA correlates well with kidney disfunction parameters (urea and creatinine) and results higher in AKI dogs. Interestingly, about 1/3 of non-AKI dogs presents abnormal SDMA that can be related to a subclinical kidney impairment.No disclosures to report.Evaluation of a point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay for detection of significant bacteriuria in dogs and cats S.S. From 1 , M.F. Drews 1 , P. Damborg 1 , L.R. Jessen 1 , A.B. Kjaergaard 2 , T.M. Sørensen 1 1 University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark, 2 AniCura Københavns Dyrehospital, Copenhagen, Denmark There is a need for affordable point-of-care (POC) tests to accurately detect significant bacteriuria in dogs and cats. Such tests may help practitioners in limiting unnecessary empirical antimicrobial treatment while improving patient outcome. The aim of the study was to compare a lateral flow immunoassay POC (RapidBac™Vet) for detection of bacteriuria, to standard aerobic quantitative bacterial culture (QBC) at a reference laboratory. The study was designed as a prospective cohort study. Urine samples were collected from dogs and cats presenting to the University Hospital for Companion Animals. Samples were subjected in parallel to RapidBac-Vet and QBC. POC results were interpreted by six investigators blinded to the gold standard results for coefficient of variation calculations. Surplus urine samples from 79 dogs and 21 cats were included (58% by cystocentesis). Forty-four samples yielded ≥1000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml on QBC, of which 20 yielded heavy growth (≥100 000 CFU/mL). POC sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 71%, 77%, 71% and 77%, respectively. Eight of the 13 false negative samples grew Staphylococcus spp.By applying a cut-off of ≥100 000 CFU/mL, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values changed to 80%, 65%, 36% and 93%, respectively. The intra-assay and inter-rater coefficients of variation were 1.4-3.23% and 83%, respectively.These results suggest that RapidBac™Vet is of limited value as a sole discriminatory test for urinary tract infection. A negative test result does not rule out urinary tract infection but may justify withholding of antimicrobial therapy pending the urine culture result.\\nESVNU-P-10 Risk factors for urinary tract infection in dogs with natural occurring leptospirosis: a retrospective cohort study of 76 dogs V. Pantaleo, T. Furlanello, M. Caldin San Marco Veterinary Clinic, Veggiano, Italy Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. Due to the risk of dog-to human transmission of leptospirosis and the need of monitoring urine output in dogs with acute kidney injury it is highly recommended to place an indwelling urinary catheter during hospitalization. Urinary catheterization can predispose to urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate type and frequency of UTI in dogs with leptospirosis and to identify risk factors associated with UTI in leptospirotic dogs.The electronic data-base of the San Marco Veterinary Clinic P.O.A System-Plus 9.0 was searched between January-2008 and December-2018 for dogs with diagnosis of leptospirosis (n = 78). Diagnosis of leptospirosis was consistent clinicopathologic signs, a positive microscopic agglutination test (titer ≥1:1600 in vaccinated dogs, titer ≥1:800 in non-vaccinated dogs or ≥ 4-fold increase in convalescent titer) and/or a positive PCR (urine and/or blood). Dogs with leptospirosis to be included in the study need to met the following criteria: negative urine sediment and urine culture at arrival, ≥ 3 days hospitalization, and a urine sample for cytologic examination and bacterial culture during hospitalization. Dogs meeting inclusion criteria were divided in 2 groups: catheterized dogs (group 1) and noncatheterized dogs (group 2). Differences in UTI frequency between groups was evaluated (Fisher\\'s exact test). Association between duration of catheterization and risk of developing UTI was analysed (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Age, sex, diarrhoea, antecedent antibacterial and/or immunosuppressive treatment were evaluated for association with UTI (Chi-square test). Significance level for all statistical test was set at α < 0.05. A total of 76 dogs met inclusion criteria: 25 in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Overall 5/76 (7%, all in group 1) dogs developed a UTI. Identified bacteria were: Escherichia coli (3 dogs), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 dog) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 dog). All UTI were defined as multidrug-resistant. Frequency of UTI was signifi-OR = ∞; CI = 2.082 -∞). Infected dogs had a significantly longer catheterization time (median = 6 days, IQR = 2.3) compared to noninfected dogs (median = 2 days, IQR = 2.6; P = 0.026). Age, sex, diarrhoea, antecedent antibacterial and/or immunosuppressive treatment were not significantly associated with UTI. Urinary catheterization and duration of urinary catheterization represented important risk factors for development of UTI in dogs with Leptospirosis.\\nthan human or canine urine, thus human refractometer scales may result in falsely high readings for feline samples. There are some commercially available veterinary refractometers that are calibrated with different scales for cats and a conversion formula has also been recommended if a refractometer with human scale is used in order to avoid overestimation of the USG in cats. Two recent studies questioned whether a separate scale is necessary for the correct interpretation of the refractometer readings in feline urine.The aim of this study was to compare canine and feline USG readings obtained by a commercial human refractometer with weight/volume measurement USG data. A second aim of the study was to test whether the centrifugation of the urine samples may have an effect on the accuracy of refractometric USG determination.The USG of thirteen canine and fifteen feline urine left over specimens were compared using refractometry and precise weight/volume mea-surement. All urine samples were clear, pale to dark yellow in color. The bias between the two methods was determined by Bland-Altman analysis. The measurements were performed both on uncentrifuged and centrifuged samples. The effect of centrifugation was evaluated by paired T test. The median (1st, 3rd quartiles) USG of the canine samples was 1015 (1008, 1024). The mean (AESD) USG of the feline samples was 1033 (AE11). There were no significant differences between the refractometric USG values of canine or feline urine samples before and after centrifugation. The mean bias between the refractometric and weight/volume determined USG values of the feline samples was 1,8 AE 2,4. Using the generally accepted feline correction formula changed the mean bias to −3,1 AE 3,6. For comparison, the mean bias of the canine samples was −2,9 AE 5,7. Based on our results we can conclude that it is unnecessary to use different scales or correction formulas during the refractometric USG determination of canine or feline urine samples. The use of the feline correction formula may result in a clinically important underestimation of the USG. The USG measurements can be performed both on native and centrifuged urine samples if the urine is clear. The inaccuracies of the refractometers irrespective of the species should be taken into consideration during the clinical decision making.\\nJ. Duque 1 , A. Ayuso 1 , B. Macías-García 1 , P.

N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and glutamyl https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-andbiological-sciences/transferases (GGT) are hydrolytic enzymes found in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the kidney being their presence in the urine associated to tubular damage. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic power of urinary NAG and GGT as early markers of renal disease in dogs affected with leishmaniasis using a modified IRIS chronic kidney disease staging. A prospective study was conducted in 5 groups of dogs:17 healthy dogs (C),13 dogs (G1) with an urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UP/C) ≤0.2 <1.4 mg/dL and 15 dogs (G4) with UP/C ≥ 0.41 and CR≥1.4 mg/dL. Dogs presented to the University of Extremadura small animal hospital with a variety of clinical signs and diagnosed with visceral Leishmaniasis were included in the study. All dogs had haematology, biochemistry, blood protein electrophoresis, Leishmania ELISA (quantititative), abdominal ultrasonography, and full urine analysis and culture (including UP/C, NAG and GGT) carried out.NAG was determined using a commercial kit (Diazyme ® , Germany),GGT by a specific kit from RAL ® (Spain). The results are all normalized to their respective urinary creatinine and expressed as ratios: uNAG/ CR and uGGT/CR.

       "       'INTRODUCTION A number of iridoids and secoiridoids which possess a wide range of biological activity have been isolated from plants and insects. For example, dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone, iridomyrmecin, isoiridomyrmecin, neoneptalactone, nepetalactone, actinidine (iridoid alkaloid) and dihydroacUnidiolid (carotenoid metabolite), the mixture being a potent attractant for cat, have been isolated from Actinidia polygama Miq. (Fig. 1). Similarly neomatatabiol, isoneomatatabiol, dehydroiridodiol, iridodiol and matatabiol have been isolated from the same plant and the mixture serves as a potent attractant for lace wing (Fig. Attractants for Felidae (Cat family) Attractants for Chrysopidae (lacewing) From a synthetic and biosynthetic point of view, dehydroiridodial, chrysomelidial and iridodial are considered to be the central intermediates for the biosynthesis of other iridoids from Actinidia polygama Miq.. The chemical interconversion of these iridoids has been demonstrated as shown in Scheme 1.\\nt-BuPhaSiCl, Imidazol b) DHP, CSA, 91% fromgenipin c) DIBAL, 94% d) BaMn04, 91% e)PPTS,93% f) (Me)2CHCH2C02H, Im2CO, cat. DBU, 87%,\\nthe course of a search for tumor inhibitors of plant origin, Kupchan et al. (23) isolated several iridoids from Allamanda catharica Linn (Apocyanaceae). These are allamandin, allamandicin, allamdin, plumericin and isoplumericin. Members of this class exhibit cytotoxic, antileukemic, Allamandicin, Plumericin (Scheme 8), and Plumieride (Scheme 9) In 1983, Trost et al. (25) reported the synthesis of plumericin and allamandin by using the concept of substitutive spiroannulation and new carbomethoxylation of an enol ether starting from bicyclo[3,3,0]-octenone derivative. Allamcin (26), isolated from Allamanda sp. was synthesized by Pattenden et al. (27) in 1986 also starting from bicyclo[3,3,0]-octenon derivative. On the other hand.\\nIn this section we would like to describe an efficient synthesis of 43 and 44 from (+)genipin. It is anticipated that the introduction of the double bond at the C1-C9 position would make the dehydrogenation of C5-H and C6-H feasible to result in the formation of the desired aromatic system. We have been reported (39) the first synthesis of 43 from genipin. To approach the synthesis of other compounds involving the same aromatic system with different side chains, we\\nunderwent thermal decomposition smoothly to give the eliminated compound. Thus, treatment of 47 with l,r-thiocarbonyldiimidazole in benzene afforded the thioimidazolide. Since the product was too unstable for isolation, it was then heated up in refluxing benzene giving rise to the key intermediate 48. Upon treatment of 48 with DDQ in benzene, the expected dehydrogenation between C5-C6 and oxidation of the allyHc carbon occurred to give 43 as yellow needle crystals in 37% overall yield. All the experimental procedures could be carried out in a one-pot procedure and under mild conditions. Considering this successful synthetic route, the synthesis of cerbinal 43 would be hope to up to an industry scale. t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, imidazole, CH2CI2, -100% b) l,r-thiocarbonyldiimidazole, benzene, rt, overnight c) AIBN, benzene, reflux, 3 h d) 1.5 eq.

PPTS, THF-H2O, rt, 2 h, 66% Scheme 10 Protection of the aldehyde moiety in 43 with 2,2-dimethy 1-1,3-propanediol in the presence of a catalytic amount of a weaker acid PPTS was achieved to afford 49. Treatment of 49 with DIBAL/THF at -78 °C successfully afforded the key intermediate 50 in 42% yield. Although four equivalents of DIBAL were used, the activity of DIBAL decreased because of the use of THF as a solvent, and it led to the recovery of 49 in 23% yield. Subsequent acetylation of 50 gave 51 in good yield. Deprotection of 51 with catalytic amount of PPTS successfully afforded baldrinal in 66%\\nHowever, treatment of 55 with tributylstannyl lithium gave the desired 1,4-adduct in only 23% yield along with the dimeric product. The dimer might be formed by 1,4-addition of the a-anion of 55 to the starting exomethylene ketone. Presumably tributylstannyl lithium acted as base. When triphenylstannyl lithium was allowed to react with the exomethylene ketone 55, however, the normal 1,4-adduct 56 was obtained in 70% yield. After reduction of 56, treatment of the resulting alcohol with lead tetraacetate did not afford any secologanin aglycone-O-methyl ether. Presumably, electron withdrawing phenyl groups decrease the electron density on the tin atom causing destabilization of the P-carbonium ion or radical intermediate. Hypercovalent bond formation of tin with y-hydroxy group may also retard the fragmentation reaction.Thus, it was necessary to find an effective reagent which gives the 1,4-adduct of tributyltin to the cisoid enone such as 55. Attempts to use ate complexes, (PhSCuSnBu3)\"Li\"^ and n-Bu3SnCu»Me2S-LiBr (49) also gave the desired ketone in low yield. The dimeric product was formed as a by-product. Fortunately, it was found that (trimethylsilyl)tributylstannane was an excellent reagent for 1,4-addition of tributyltin group to cisoid enone(50). Thus, the exomethylene ketone 55 reacted cleanly with the above reagent in the presence of both a catalytic amount of KCN and 18-crown-6 to afford the desired silyl enol ether which was subjected to selective removal of trimethylsilyl group with n-Bu4NF in the presence of acetic acid. The keto stannane 56 was obtained in high yield from 55. Finally, the synthesis of secologanin aglycone-o-silyl ether (58) was achieved by reduction of 56 followed by oxidative fragmentation with lead tetraacetate. It should be noted that in contrast to Grob type fragmentation (44) this oxidative fragmentation proceeded from both cis and trans isomers in respect of the hydroxyl and tributylstannylmethyl groups of 57.Sweroside aglycone-0-silyl ether(59) was obtained by the reduction of secologanin aglycone silylether (58) with sodium borohydride quantitatively.\\nwas converted to its enamine with piperidine and phenyl selenyl group was introduced into the a position of the aldehyde to give 60 in 91% overall yield. Oxidation of 60 with NaI04 gave the a,p-unsaturated aldehyde 61 in 72% yield. Treatment of 61 with NaBH4 in methanol resulted in the formation of gentiopicroside aglycone-0-silyl ether (63) (20%) contaminated with the allyl alcohol 62 (38%). We attempted the conversion of the allyl alcohol 62 into gentiopicroside aglycone silylether (63) by the photosensitized isomerization of the double bond in the presence of a catalytic amount of base (54). Irradiation of 62 in the presence of both catalytic amount of NaOMe as base and 2-acetonaphthone as sensitizer at 0 °C resulted in the formation of the desired gentiopicroside aglycone silylether (63) in good yields. Similar irreversible photoisomerization was carried out in the synthesis of manoalide as shown below (55). Kingiside, Morronoside and Sarracenin (Scheme 13)\\nThe exomethylene ketone 55, which was also a key intermediate in the synthesis of the secologanin aglycone(58), was hydrogenated to give the cyclopentanone 65.The stereochemistry was completely controlled by the approach of the catalyst from the convex face of 55. The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the labile cyclopentanone 65 gave the kingiside aglycone-O-silyl ether (64). Morronoside aglycone-O-silyl ether (67) was obtained by chemoselective reduction of kingiside aglycone-O-silyl ether (64) with excess diborane. Reduction of 64 with 1 eq. DIBAL at -78 °C, however, afforded a mixture of the starting material and the diol. Desilylation of 67 followed by cyclization under acidic condition furnished (-)-sarracenin. 8-£p/-sarracenin was also synthesized from 8-e/7/-kingiside aglycone silylether via S-^pZ-morronoside silylether by the same procedure.\\nFigure 3\\nthe efficient synthesis of optically active petiodial, we started from the easily obtainable (+)-genipin. Silylation of genipin gave disilyl ether 27 which was subjected to reduction with DIBAL to give the alcohol 72 in 92% yield from genipin. Alkylation of the mesylate prepared in situ from 72 was successful at low temperature as follows. Alcohol 72 was treated with n-BuLi in THF at -78 °C followed by addition of mesyl chloride, and the lithium anion of geranyl tolyl sulfone(63) was reacted with the mesylate 73 prepared as above to give desired alkylated compound 74 in 80% yield. Attempts to detect the intermediary mesylate by thin layer chromatography was unsuccessful because of its instability at room temperature, as encountered in the corresponding chloride, and trichloroacetate. This result suggests that these type of iridoids having a good leaving group at Cn decompose readily at room temperature. Selective desilylation of 74 with PPTS in ethanol gave the monosilyl ether (75), which was subjected to reduction to afford the alcohol 76 in 64% yield.Acetylation of 76 followed by rapid treatment with n-Bu4NF afforded the hemiacetal 77 in 93% yield. This compound was a positional isomer of the double bond in petiodial. Isomerization of the double bond in the five membered ring of 77 proved to be unexpectedly difficult and highly critical conditions were required for this isomerization. Refluxing an anhydrous benzene solution (0.05 M in substrate) of the hemiacetal 77 containing 0.5 equivalent of diazabicycloundecene (DBU) afforded the dial 78 and its stereoisomer 79 in 80% yield. More vigorous conditions or use of THF as solvent gave the desired compounds in lower yield. Treatment with other bases such as sodium hydride or sodium hydroxide under various reaction conditions gave only trace amounts of the desired compounds. From the mixture obtained above, each stereoisomer, 78 and 79 was isolated by thin layer chromatography respectively with a ratio of 3:2. ^H-and l^C-NMR spectra of the major component 78 were identical with those of the natural petiodial. The sign of optical rotations of the synthesized petiodial 78 {[a\\\\\\\\y^^ + 32.9° (c=1.2, CHCI3))was opposite to that of the natural compound ([aJo^^ -28° (c=1.5, CHCI3)), our synthetic petiodial 78 was therefore the antipode of natural one. Thus, the first synthesis of the enantiomer of natural petiodial was achieved efficiently, and the absolute stereochemistry of the stereogenic center at €5 in natural petiodial was determined as S configuration.\\nby Swern oxidation. Each diastereoisomer of the diol 80 and 81 was subjected to oxidation with BaMn04 (65) to give the lactone 82 and its isomer 83, respectively. The stereochemistry of 82 and 83 was elucidated respectively by comparing their ^H-NMR spectra with those of neonepetalactone and iso-neonepetalactone (66). Thus the methylene protons in the lactone ring of 82were observed at 6 4.35 and 4.24 ppm as a part of an ABX pattern (JAB=11.5 HZ, JAX=3.0 HZ, JBX=2.0 HZ), while those of 83 were at 5 4.39 and 3.94 ppm, (JAB=11.0 HZ, JAX=4.0 HZ, JBX=11.0 HZ). The above features of the iH-NMR spectra of both lactones 82 and 83 were in good agreement with those of the corresponding methylene protons of neonepetalactone (5 4.34 and 4.19, dd, JAB=1 1-0 Hz, JAX=3.0 HZ, JBX=3.0 HZ) and iso-neonepetalactone (5 4.24 and 3.89, dd, JAB=11-0 HZ, JAX=5.0 HZ, JBX=11-0 HZ), whose stereochemistry has been established. We could therefore assign the relative stereochemistry between C^ and C7 in (+)-petiodial 78 as (6R, 7S). The absolute structure of natural (-)-petiodial was then determined as {6S, 7R ).\\nFigure. 4\\n4\\n0,02\\'^]octan-3-one (2) in 83% overall yield.\\ntetramethylethylenediamine, followed by trapping of the produced vinyl anion with DMF gave the a,p-unsaturated aldehyde in 36% yield. Oxidation of the aldehyde with active Mn02 in the presence of HCN in CH3OH at room temperature for 18 h afforded the a,p-unsaturated ester 8 in 82% yield.On the other hand, direct conversion of 7 to 8 was also accomplished in 32% overall yield by treatment of 7 with BuLi and then trapping of the produced vinyl anion with methyl chloroformate instead of DMF. Deprotonation of 8 with lithium diisopropylamide in THF at -78 °C produced the lithium enolate of 8 in situ, which was kinetically protonated by exposure to aqueous acetic acid at 0\\nwas isolated from the bark of Cerbera manghas L. in 1977. It was later isolated from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis again in 1986 (35). Cerbinal was reported to show antifugal activity against Bipolaris sorokiniana, Helminthosporium, Pyricularia,\\n(Both 84 and 85 indicate tentative absolute structures of natural udoteatrial and udoteatrial hydrate)Oxidation of genipin with barium manganate followed by hydrogenation with Rh/Al203 afforded stereoselectively the tricyclic hemiacetal 87, which was then converted into the methylacetal 88. Reduction of 88 followed by acetylation gave the acetate 89 in good yield.Bromohydrin formation with NBS-H2O followed by Swern oxidation afforded the corresponding bromoacetate 90, which was successively treated with zinc in acetic acid(70) to give the key intermediate 86. With 86 in hand, the stereochemistry at C7 was then considered carefully, and the stereochemistry at C7 was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis of model compounds.Thus, treatment of the lithium salt of geranyl sulfone with 86 afforded the 1,4-addition product 91. Since the removal of the sulfone group from 91 was unsuccessful, the lactone carbonyl in 91 was temporarily reduced and protected with TBDMS to give the acetal 92.Birch reduction (71) of the sulfone moiety in 92 afforded the compound 93, which was deprotected and oxidized with PCC to afford homogeranyl lactone (94 and 95) as a mixture of diastereoisomers, of which the ratio was found to be 3:1 by iR-NMR spectroscopy. This mixture was separated by HPLC and the major isomer 94 could be isomerized into a 1:1 mixture of 94 and 95 under the influence of DBU in refluxing toluene. Reduction of the ahomogeranyl lactone 94 with DIBAL followed by acid hydrolysis of the resulting hemiacetal accomplished the synthesis of 85. In order to determine the absolute configuration of natural udoteatrial hydrate, 85 was converted to the diacetate 97 and 98, the spectral data of which were in good agreement with those reported previously. The signs of optical rotations of our synthetic diacetates, however, were opposite to those of natural diacetates which confirms the absolute configuration of natural udoteatrial hydrate as {2R, 3S, 6S, 7S) as shown in Scheme 15.

Next, preliminary investigations of the structure and activity relationships of the synthetic analogues of e«r-udoteatrial hydrate was examined. The homogeranyl lactone 95 was reduced with DIBAL followed by acid hydrolysis of the resulting hemiacetal to afford the ent-1-epiudoteatrial hydrate (96). Acetylation of 96 was found to give the acetate 99 as the sole product. To examine the effect of the side chain on the biological activities, we chose the compound bearing the methyl group as a simple side chain to compare with those involving the homogeranyl group. Thus, hydrogenation of 86 with Rh/Al203 stereoselectively afforded the p-methyl derivative 100 (Scheme 16). The a-methyl isomer 101 could be obtained by base catalyzed isomerization of 100. Compounds 100 and 101 were converted into the diacetates 102, 103 and 104, respectively, by the same reaction sequence as that described for the preparation of 97, 98 and 99 from 94 and 95.

The biological properties of these analogues (97, 98, 99,102, 103 and 104) were then examined. Although the natural udoteatrial hydrate was reported to show antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, none of these analogues was active against various microogranisms. At this moment it was not clear whether protection of the two hemiacetal portions of 85 as acetate would decrease the activities of the natural product.\\nCytotoxicity of analogues of ^Air-udoteatrial hydrate against human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB and human lung carcinoma A-549In conclusion, we have found that the analogues of ^«r-udoteatrial hydrate were cytotoxic against human carcinoma in vitro. For the exhibition of cytotoxicity the presence of the homogeranyl side chain as well as the stereochemistry of the acetoxy group at C19 seemed to be important factors. Our findings reported here may be valuable for the evaluation of new lead-compounds for cancer chemotherapy. The question we are facing is whether the diacetates of natural udoteatrial hydrate would show comparable cytotoxicity.',\n",

Predicted protein products from the structural (VP4 to VP1) and non-structural (PRO-protease; POL-polymerase) regions are indicated. Regions are shaded alternatively for convenience and numbering indicates positions of predicted protease cleavage according to the start of the HRV-QPM polyprotein. Dashed lines indicate regions involved in species classifications. (B) HRV A2 amino acid similarity to HRV A (n = 34) and B (n = 13), or HEV (n = 71) strains as determined by SimPlotß analysis. Plots indicate the percentage similarity of a 50% consensus sequence from each species' polyprotein compared to the HRV A2 strains. Average similarity across the polyprotein is indicated by dotted line. Averaged values for the complete coding, P1 and 2C+3CD regions are indicated within the inset of each panel. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001847.g001\\nComparison of predicted protomers. (A) A simplified depiction of two protomers in opposition on a viral capsid (shaded areas, adapted from[37]). As a guide for visualising loop length, a dashed and a dotted line are spaced equidistantly and represent proximal and distal positions from the virion core, respectively. (B) Ribbon depiction of two opposing viral protomers from HRV-QPM, HRV-2 (minor group) and HRV-14 (major group). HRV-QPM proteins were predicted by in silico matching to the empirically derived HRV-16 and HRV-14 structure (materials and methods). Protomers consist of one copy each of VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. b-sheets are depicted as flat arrows and a-helices as coiled ribbons. The formation of VP1-VP3 into eight anti-parallel b-sheets is indicative of the 'jellyroll' conformation typical in picornaviruses. Major differences in the predicted HRV-QPM VP1 include the shortened external loops between b-sheets (asterisk) and an additional C-terminal sheet-loop-sheet formation (arrow indicates the same location on all protomers for comparison). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001847.g002 QPM capsid for the presence of footprints reportedly used by CV-A21 (which employs ICAM-1 as a receptor), Echovirus (EV)-11 (DAF), Poliovirus-1 (PVR) and CV-B3 (CAR).\\nPredicted HRV-QPM pentamers compared to representative major (HRV-14) and minor (HRV-2) group HRV pentamers derived from crystallography data.

In partnership with WHO, UNICEF, the American Red Cross, the UN Foundation, and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, his leadership has been critical to the following achievements:• The elimination of indigenous measles in all countries of the Americas for nearly 2 years. Consequently, measles importations from Latin America, which used to be the most common source of imported measles into the United States, have decreased to zero since 2000. • A 5-year global action plan to reduce by 2005 the number of deaths from measles in children by 50 percent (compared with 1999 estimates) is being implemented, with CDC as a major partner. During 2001 to 2003, campaigns against measles have been conducted in 29 countries in Africa, with more than 112 million children being immunized and an estimated 266,000 deaths being prevented. • An integral part of the global polio-eradication program is a highly functional global surveillance system for acute flaccid paralysis and polioviruses. This system includes a network of 145 accredited poliovirus laboratories and a massive infrastructure of trained managers and staff and logistics. The system also is providing the backbone for developing surveillance for other vaccinepreventable diseases and will play a central role in a global early outbreak detection system.To achieve these goals, Cochi has worked closely with UN agencies and private sector partners, including WHO, UNICEF, Pan American Health Organization, Rotary International, the United Nations Foundation, American Red Cross, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cres-cent Societies, The World Bank, and Ministries of Health in developing middle-income countries.\\nDr. Cochi administering a dose of oral poliomyelitis vaccine to a child in Nairobi, Kenya, during National Immunization Days, September 1997.

Influenza viruses commonly cause a self-limited acute respiratory infection manifested as fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and occasionally, gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore aminotransferase levels are not monitored routinely. In the 2004 H1N5 influenza outbreak, however, about 60% of patients with pneumonia had deranged liver function test values and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea on initial evaluation. 203 Of note, among other extrahepatic abnormalities, autopsy revealed hepatic centrolobular necrosis, although neither viral antigen detection nor RT-PCR could provide evidence of viral liver disease. 204 Thus liver damage in patients dying of influenza has been considered immune mediated, in particular because high cytokine levels were detected. 205 Of note, in 4 of 15 volunteers infected intranasally with influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1), markedly elevated aminotransferase levels also transiently developed.',\n",

Following translation, the nascent protein (red) enters into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a translocon pore (SEC61) where it sequentially interacts with a network of chaperones and enzymes to acquire its correct higher order structure. During entry into the ER, the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OST) transfers a preformed Glc 3 Man 9 NAc 2 glycan precursor to the Asn of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif in the polypeptide chain. The two outermost glucose residues are then sequentially removed by glucosidase I (G-I) and glucosidase II (G-II) signalling entry of the resulting monoglucosylated (GlcMan 9 NAc 2 ) protein into the calnexin (CNX)/calreticulin (CRT) folding cycle. Calnexin is the membrane-bound homologue of calreticulin and preferentially interacts with nascent proteins associated with the ER membrane (only calreticulin is indicated in this diagram for the sake of simplicity). This interaction with CNX/CRT facilitates the co-ordinated activities of other chaperones such as the oxidoreductase ERp57 to further assist with folding. Incorrectly folded proteins are reglucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) signalling their re-entry into the CNX/CRT folding cycle to undergo another round of chaperone-mediated folding. In contrast, correctly folded proteins are acted on by G-II, resulting in the removal of their remaining glucose residue. This signals release from the CNX/CRT pathway enabling export of the protein into the Golgi. Glycoproteins may undergo several rounds of chaperone-mediated folding to assume the correct quaternary structure before continuing along the secretory pathway. In contrast, terminally misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation via the endoplasmic reticulinassociated degradation (ERAD) pathway.\\n2018 The Authors.

Their figures estimated that the total number of infected individuals in greater Wuhan alone on the 25th January 2020 was 75,815 (95% confidence interval [CI] 37,304-130,330)\\nThe putative zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, and the zoonotic origins of the SARS and MERS epidemics, brings into sharp focus the existence of unregulated wet markets in China, trading in live wild game, game meat and game products. Zoonotic origins for emerging viral infections are not new, with AIDS, Ebola, influenza viruses, SARS, MERS, and a multitude of other viral illnesses all crossing the species barrier and causing devastating illness in humans, at enormous economic and human cost[10] . The presence and availability of markets that trade in wild animals for human consumption, and for purchase as pets, greatly increases the potential for viral infections originatingfrom these reservoir animals to jump to human populations. The complete ban on market trading and sale of wild game meat in China on 26 th January 2020 will help prevent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the current epidemic and, to a certain degree, help prevent emergence of new zoonotic infections. Further social and cultural changes regarding wild game trading and consumption is required in China and worldwide, to prevent scenarios where regular emergence of zoonotic infections becomes commonplace, with their inevitably attendant economic and human costs. It is estimated that the SARS epidemic cost the global economy approximately $US 54 billion in 2003 alone. The 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea resulted in a $US 2.6 billion loss for the South Korean tourism industry alone. The 2014 outbreak of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone costed their already lean economies approximately $US 300 million.

This stimulatory effect of ACh at the postganglionic axon Efferent pathways: Major preganglionic and postganglionic neural pathways from the spinal cord to the lower urinary tract.\\nInnervation of the lower urinary tract: The parasympathetic pelvic nerve stimulates the bladder detrusor muscle, mediated by muscarinic receptors (M 3 ) being activated by ACh. The sympathetic hypogastric nerve stimulates urethral smooth muscle and inhibits bladder detrusor, mediated by a 1 -adrenergic and b 3 -adrenergic receptors, respectively. The somatic pudendal nerve stimulates striated muscle of the EUS, mediated by ACh activating nicotinic (N) receptors. ACh, acetylcholine; NE, norepinephrine. Plus and minus signs indicate neural stimulation and inhibition, respectively.\\nA hypothetical diagram demonstrates working model of bladder dysfunction in PD. Micturition reflex is controlled by spinobulbospinal pathways through PAG in midbrain and PMC in brainstem. This neural circuit is under control of higher centers, including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other cortex regions. (A) Under normal conditions tonic inhibition from ACC suppress micturition reflex. Tonic firing (1) of dopaminergic neurons in SN activates dopamine D 1 receptors expressed on GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the striatum to induce tonic GABAergic inhibition (À) of the micturition reflex at the level of PAG. At the same time, D 1 receptor stimulation suppresses the activity of adenosinergic neurons, which exert an excitatory effect on micturition via adenosine A 2A receptors (1). (B) In PD, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) are lost (lesion), leading to the loss of dopamine D 1 receptors activation (D 1 [loss of activation]), which results in reduced activation inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the striatum (GABA [loss of inhibition]). At the same time, reduced D 1 receptor stimulation enhances the adenosinergic mechanism to stimulate adenosine A 2A receptors (adenosine A 2A [11]), leading to facilitation of the spinobulbospinal pathway controlling the micturition reflex pathway. Administration of dopamine D 1 receptor agonist (SKF 38393) can restore the GABAergic nerve activity and suppress A 2A receptor-mediated activation to reduce bladder overactivity in PD. Also, administration of adenosine A 2A antagonists (ZM241385 or istradefylline) can suppress A 2A receptor-mediated activation of the micturition reflex to reduce bladder overactivity in PD. Dopamine D 2 receptors (D 2 [1]) expressed in the spinal cord enhances the micturition reflex. (Modified from Kitta T, Chancellor MB, de Groat WC, et al.

Representative recordings of simultaneous measurement of intravesical pressure (IVP) and EUS-EMG activity or urethral perfusion pressure (UPP) in a rat (A and B) or a mouse (C). The EUS-EMG exhibits tonic activity before the onset of voiding and bursting activity during voiding (A). The bursting produces rhythmic contractions and relaxation of the EUS and is thought to generate a urethral pumping action during voiding, which is seen as high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) on UPP (B). In contrast, most mice exhibited reduced EUS activity without bursting and no obvious pressure oscillation on the cystometrogram during voiding.

In England and Wales in 1969  there were over 23,500 cases of \"infective jaundice\" notified. By 1979 this had fallen to 3,300 cases, a reduction of over 85%. Most of this reduction can be attributed to the declining incidence of hepatitis A virus infections(Galbraith, N.S.,  Forbes, P., Mayon-White, R.T. 1980). Since a high proportion of young adults in the U.K. are susceptible, it is important that they should be protected from hepatitis A virus infection by the passive administration of pooled normal human immunoglobulin prior to visiting hepatitis A virus endemic parts of the world.VIRUSES CAUSING ACUTE GASTROENTERITISRotaviruses and parvovirus-like viruses undoubtedly cause acute gastroenteritis. However, the role of such other viruses as adenoviruses, astroviruses, calici viruses and coronaviruses are perhaps less well established although it now seems probable that enteric adneovirus, astrovirus and caliciviruses may from time to time be associated with cases or outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal disease.Rotaviruses are the commonest cause of acute non-bacterial disease in infancy and childhood. The virus particles are approximately 70 nm in diameter, contain double stranded RNA and represent a separate genus in the family of reoviridae. The virus particle has a double capsid layer, having a sharply defined smooth rim [outer capsid) surrounding spoke-like sub-units [inner capsid) which radiate outwards from a hub-like core [Fig. 1c). Some virus particles may be devoid of the external capsid.Fig. 1d. Rotavirus (the outer capsid layer is present on all these particles]The accumulated data from a number of studies conducted in temperate climates has shown that rotaviruses may be detected in approximately 40-50% of infants admitted to hospital with acute diarrhoeal disease although in winter months the proportion may rise to 70-80% (Davidson, G.P., Bishop, R.F., Townely, R.R.W., and others\\nshows the incidence and seasonal distribution of rotavirus infection in various tropical countries in which studies have been carried out for sufficiently long to take seasonal factors into account.Pilford, J.N., and others, 1978]. U.S. workers employing enzyme immuno assay have shown that their two major subtypes have a world wide distribution and that sequentially acquired infections are usually the result of infection by a different serotype. Infection caused by one subtype does not appear to protect against infection by the other. It appears that infection by both serotypes occurs early in life throughout the world for by approximately 18 months of age.',\n",

Nous rapportons une observation de syndrome vestibulaire chez une adulte suivie pour HL. Une femme âgée de 68 ans était suivie pour une HL avec atteinte osseuse et cutanée diagnostiquée en 1997 et compliquée d\\'un diabète insipide traité par Minirin&#61650;. En juillet 2004, elle rapportait un syndrome vertigineux évoluant par crises avec instabilité à la marche, acouphènes et sensibilité mastoïdienne droite. L\\'enregistrement vidéonystagmographique retrouvait un nystagmus spontané et une hyporéflexie vestibulaire droite. L\\'audiométrie tonale montrait une hypoacousie droite de transmission. Le scanner centré sur l\\'oreille visualisait une image lacunaire au niveau de la partie inférieure et postérieure de la mastoïde droite. La scintigraphie osseuse révélait, outre les localisations connues, l\\'apparition d\\'un intense foyer de fixation dans la région de l\\'apophyse mastoïde droite. La chirurgie était récusée et l\\'évolution était favorable sous corticothérapie et rééducation vestibulaire. Les manifestations otologiques de l\\'HL se voient en cas d\\'atteinte osseuse temporale et sont essentiellement représentées par une otorrhée, une tuméfaction rétroauriculaire ou une hypoacousie (Kleinjung T, et al.

Nous rapportons un cas révélé par un choc hémorragique sur hémopéritoine. Cas clinique. -Un homme de 31 ans était hospitalisé en urgence pour une douleur brutale et violente de la fosse iliaque gauche. L\\'examen clinique initial était normal hormis la douleur. Des anti-inflammatoires et des fortes doses de morphine étaient peu efficaces. Sur le scanner abdominal, il existait une masse rétropéritonéale de 3 cm, hétérogène, en regard du carrefour iliaque gauche. Le lendemain de l\\'admission, le patient était opéré en urgence pour choc hémorragique sur hémopéritoine, rapporté à la tumeur rétropéritonéale hémorragique et rompue. Le diagnostic de synovialosarcome monophasique était posé sur l\\'histologie. Le patient est toujours sous chimiothérapie par anthracyclines. Discussion. -Seulement une vingtaine de cas de synovialosarcomes rétropéritonéaux ont été décrits dans la littérature. La localisation rétro-péritonéale est rarissime, les tumeurs se situant volontiers au voisinage des gaines et des tendons [Ziarn BH et al. Clin Orthop 1996 ; 331 : 277-82]. Les douleurs abdominales et l\\'anémie sont le mode de révélation le plus fréquent ; l\\'hémopéritoine est peu commun. Le scanner retrouve habituellement une masse hypodense se réhaussant après l\\'injection. L\\'histologie, aidée par la biologie moléculaire, pose le diagnostic [Tsuji S et al. Am J Pathol 1998, 153 :1807-12]. Le pronostic est mauvais, avec un seul cas de survie à cinq ans rapporté. La tumeur étant peu radio et chimiosensible, le traitement est essentiellement chirurgical. Sa qualité conditionne la survie [Song H et al. J Korean Med Sci 2002 ; 17 : 419-22]. Conclusion. -Le synovialosarcome est une étiologie rare des tumeurs rétro-péritonéales. Notre cas est original par la localisation et le mode de révélation de la tumeur. Une intervention chirurgicale précoce aurait permis d\\'éviter les complications et la possible dissémination rétro-péritonéale des cellules tumorales.

Après la première cure de carboplatine apparaissait un gonflement douloureux des mains. La scintigraphie osseuse objectivait une hyperfixation précoce et tardive de la main gauche compatible avec une algodystrophie. Un traitement par Calcitonine puis AINS était inefficace. Elle consultait en avril 2004, après la troisième cure de carboplatine, traitement qui avait permis la diminution du Ca 125 de 369 U/l à 51 UI/l (N < 35). On notait un oedème des mains, un érythème et une sclérose sous cutanée palmaire, une raideur des poignets et une rétraction des doigts en flexion. Les épaules et les coudes étaient modérément douloureux et limités, les chevilles tuméfiées. Biologiquement, la CRP était à 6 mg/l, la VS à 15 mm/h1, les facteurs rhumatoïdes faibles à 20 UI/ml. Présence d\\'anti-corps anti-ADN dénaturé; absence d\\'antikératine et d\\'anti-antigènes nucléaires solubles. CH50, C3c, C4 normaux. L\\'arrêt de la chimiothérapie et l\\'introduction de Prednisone à 1 mg/kg/j étaient suivis d\\'une amélioration avec disparition des douleurs et de l\\'oedème mais sans modification de la rétraction digitale et de la sclérose palmaire. On notait une limitation séquellaire des épaules, coudes et poignets, par rétraction capsulaire et un nodule aponévrotique plantaire. En juillet et août, elle recevait 3 nouvelles cures de carboplatine sans réapparition de la fasciite. Discussion. -La fasciite palmaire avec polyarthrite est un syndrome paranéoplasique rare qui peut accompagner ou précéder divers cancers en particulier d\\'origine ovarienne [Hatron PY et al, in : Maladies et syndromes systémiques ; 4ème Ed, Flammarion, Paris, p 990]. Le traitement anti-tumoral peut permettre une résolution du syndrome. Une poussée de fasciite palmaire favorisée par la chimiothérapie semble inhabituelle. Un cas comparable a été décrit, avec réveil d\\'une fasciite au décours d\\'une association cyclophosphamide carboplatine administrée dans le cadre d\\'un carcinome de l\\'ovaire [Willemse P et al, Ann Rhum Dis 1991 ; 50 : 53-4].

La forme isolée est exceptionnelle. Les conséquences anatomo-cliniques sont diverses : une hernie, un bascule ou une incarcération du coeur dans l\\'hémithorax gauche. Souvent asymptomatique et de découverte fortuite, elle peut parfois \"mimer\" l\\'angine de poitrine. Nous rapportant un cas révélé par des douleurs thoraciques : Une femme de 45 ans, sans facteur de risque cardio-vasculaire ni d\\'antécedent particulier, est hospitalisée en Unité de Soins Intensifs pour la survenue de douleur thoracique médiane constrictive survenant au repos et après une vive émotion. Elle est résistante à la Trinitrine sublinguale. L\\'auscultation cardiaque et le reste de l\\'examen clinique sont sans particularité. L\\'ECG est régulier et sinusal. Il montre un bloc incomplet de branche droite, une déviation axiale droite à -130, une zone de transition vers V5 et sans anomalie de la repolarisation. La radiographie du poumon objective une forte lévoposition du coeur et une disparition du bord droit du coeur(masquer par le rachis). La troponine et le reste du bilan biologique sont normaux. L\\'échographie cardiaque transthoracique montre une forte rotation des cavités droites vers l\\'avant et un bascule du coeur à gauche. L\\'apex du ventricule gauche(VG) est basculé à gauche et en haut. Les cavités cardiaques sont de taille normale. Le diagnostic d\\'agénésie totale et isolée du péricarde gauche fortement suspecté à ce stade est confirmé par l\\'IRM cardiaque : absence de péricarde au niveau de la paroi libre du VG, interposition de parenchyme pulmonaire entre l\\'aorte et le tronc de l\\'artère pulmonaire, rotation et déviation gauche du coeur. L\\'évolution de la crise est spontanément résolutive mais les douleurs devenant de plus en plus invalidantes,la patiente bénéficiera d\\'une péricardoplastie. L\\'ECG, la radiographie pulmonaire et surtout l\\'IRM suffisent à porter le diagnostique de APG. La chirurgie par réfection du péricarde (péricardoplastie) peut être bénéfique pour soulager les crises douloureuses. Ratib O et al. Circulation. 2001;103:3154-3155.

Nous rapportons une observation de MP qui se singularise par l\\'importance des manifestations musculaires et illustre les difficultés du diagnostic de la MP. Un jeune patient de 18 ans,d\\'origine tunisienne cholécystectomisé suite à un syndrome douloureux et fébrile de l\\'hypochondre droit est réadmis 17 jours plus tard pour douleurs abdominales d\\'installation brutale avec défense et épanchement péritonéal de moyenne abondance, l\\'évolution a été favorable au bout de quelques heures avec résolution spontanée des douleurs et disparition de l\\'épanchement péritonéal. Le patient est transféré en Médecine où l\\'interrogatoire nous apprend qu\\'il a été opéré à l\\'âge de 5 ans pour appendi-cite et que depuis, il est sujet à des crises douloureuses abdominales associées à de la fièvre spontanément résolutives. Il est aussi suivi depuis l\\'âge de 8 ans dans une autre institution pour une myosite traitée par corticoïdes. Le diagnostic de MP est confirmé par l\\'étude génétique et le patient est mis sous Colchicine 1 mg/jour. Il est est réhospitalisé à 2 reprises pour des myalgies intenses tantôt diffuses intéressant les membres inférieurs et les membres supérieurs tantôt localisées au membre supérieur avec impotence fonctionnelle.Les enzymes musculaires et l\\'électromyogramme sont normaux. La mise sous colchicine ainsi que le sevrage en corticoïdes a entraîné un amendement de l\\'ensemble du tableau clinique. Les symptômes musculaires de la MP semblent plus méconnus que rares puisqu\\'ils ont été retrouvés chez 25 % des enfants d\\'une série prospective jordanienne[Majeed H et al. Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism 2000 ;30 :138 43]. Il s\\'agit essentiellement de myalgies, plus rarement de contracture musculaire et amyotrophie. Ces manifestations musculaires au cours de la MP peuvent être de cause iatrogène (colchicine) [Sayarlioglu M et al. Ann Pharmacother 2003 ;37 :1821 4], ou en rapport avec une vascularite nécrosante associée, elles constituent dans de nombreux cas une authentique manifestation de la maladie.

Quéméneur, P.-Y. Hatron Service de médecine interne, hôpital Claude-Huriez, CHRU de Lille, rue Michel-Polonovski, 59037 Lille cedex, France Le syndrome de Muckle-Wells (MWS) est une maladie héréditaire autosomique dominante caractérisée par une sensibilité au froid et le risque de surdité et, malheureusement, d\\'amylose. Les traitements en sont jusqu\\'à présent décevants. Une jeune femme de 32 ans présentait un tableau compatible avec un MWS avec des polyarthralgies, une surdité de perception bilatérale sévère appareillée depuis l\\'âge de 11 ans et un syndrome inflammatoire majeur chronique. La CRP évoluait en effet depuis 10 ans entre 60 et 80 mg/L (N<3 mg/l). L\\'étude en biologie moléculaire révélait la présence d\\'une mutation hétérozygote E311K du gène CIASI qui associée au tableau clinique rendait le diagnostic de MWS très probable. Au vu des données récentes de la littérature, un traitement par un inhibiteur des récepteurs de l\\'IL-1 (ANAKINRA) était débuté en mai 2004 à la posologie de 100 mg/j. La CRP était à 55 mg/l. Trois semaines après la CRP était à 35 mg/l. Trois mois après, la CRP était à 4 mg/l et la patiente ne portait plus ses prothèses auditives. L\\'examen audiométrique confirmait la récupération quasi-totale de la surdité. Cette observation rare vient confirmer les 3 observations de la littérature (Hawkins PN et al. Arthritis Rheum. 2004;50:607-12) mais rapporte pour la première fois une amélioration de la surdité au cours du MWS. Poster 97 Maladie de Refsum : une cause de neuropathie héréditaire curable I.

Aumaître a a Service de médecine interne b Service de neurologie, CHU Gabriel-Montpied, B.P. 69, 63003 Clermont-Ferrand cedex-1, France Une femme de 44 ans d\\'origine italienne, est hospitalisée en janvier 2004 pour une polyradiculonévrite d\\'apparition récente. Elle a des antécédents d\\'anorexie mentale, de rétinite pigmentaire depuis 15 ans et de surdité de perception depuis 1 an. Un frère a une rétinite pigmentaire. À l\\'examen il y a une neuropathie sensitivo-motrice prédominant aux membres inférieurs, avec une ichtyose sévère du tronc et des membres. L\\'existence d\\'une brachymétatarsie des 4e rayons et d\\'une brachymétacarpie des 5e rayons est confirmée par Les radiographies. L\\'électromyogramme est en faveur d\\'une polynévrite sensitivomotrice (PSM) démyélinisante. Il y a une hypokaliémie à 2,6 mmol/l due à une tubulopathie chronique. Le liquide céphalorachidien est acellulaire avec une protéinorachie à 5,10 g/l. Le taux sérique d\\'acide phytanique (AP)est très élevé à 4433,5 µmol/l (dilution isotopique, N<10,95). L\\'hospitalisation va se compliquer d\\'une anorexie favorisée par l\\'annonce du diagnostic et les plasmaphérèses. La perte de 4 kg en 15 jours va déclencher une poussée aiguë de sa neuropathie avec une tétraparésie. La reprise de poids, la rééducation et les séances de plasmaphérèse vont permettre une amélioration progressive. Après 17 séances, il reste un déficit des releveurs du pied et le taux d\\'AP est à 524 µmol/l. Commentaires. -Décrite en 1946 par le norvégien Sigvald Refsum, la maladie de Refsum associe une rétinite pigmentaire, une PSM chronique, une ataxie cérébelleuse et une dissociation albuminocytologique. D\\'autres signes sont fréquents : ichtyose, surdité cochléaire, malformations osseuses (30%) et anosmie. Les atteintes cardiaque et rénale sont rares. La rétinite pigmentaire révèle souvent la maladie. Le lien avec la surcharge en AP a été établi en 1963. Il s\\'agit d\\'un déficit en phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase. La transmission est autosomique récessive. Les mutations siègent sur le gène PHYH, chromosome 10p13. Le traitement repose sur la plasmaphérèse et un régime dépourvu de phytol. Cependant le régime ne doit pas entraîner d\\'amaigrissement car il y a alors relargage massif d\\'AP. Le taux initial chez notre patiente est un des plus élevés observé, l\\'amélioration clinique n\\'a été amorcée qu\\'à la reprise du poids.

Nous rapportons une observation particulière par l\\'absence de néoplasie associée et l\\'évolution vers une polyarthrite rhumatoïde. Une patiente de 47 ans, aux antécédents de maladie de Basedow, consulte en octobre 2002 pour des douleurs des 2 mains. L\\'examen retrouve une rétraction en flexion irréductible des doigts, associée à un oedème des mains et un aspect épaissi, induré et erythémateux des paumes. Il existe une arthrite des IPP. Sur le plan biologique, on note un syndrome inflammatoire modéré, avec VS 34, CRP 15 ; Les ACAN sont positifs au 1/160è, sans spécificité. Le complément et ses fractions sont normaux.\\nsyndrome fasciite-polyarthrite est habituellement considéré comme un syndrome paranéoplasique. Dans 30% des cas il est associé à un cancer de l\\'ovaire [Vinker S et al. Clin Rheumatol 1996 ; 15 : 495-7], ce qui a motivé la réalisation d\\'une ovariectomie chez notre patiente porteuse d\\'un kyste. L\\'association à d\\'autres types variés de cancers a été décrite [Grados F et al. Rev Rhum Engl Ed 1998 ; 65 : 212-214].

Le Jeunne a a Service de médecine interne b Service d\\'ophtalmologie, hôpital Hôtel-Dieu, 1, place du parvis de Notre-Dame, 75181 Paris cedex-4, France La kératite ulcérante perforante (KUP) est une complication grave de la polyarthrite rhumatoïde (PR), le plus souvent rencontrée dans les formes sévères, anciennes avec vascularite. Observation. -Nous rapportons le cas d\\'une patiente de 74 ans, d\\'origine indienne, adressée pour l\\'exploration d\\'une kératite ulcérante perforante (KUP) bilatérale évoluant depuis 8 mois. L\\'examen clinique retrouve une déformation du pouce droit, sans aucune douleur articulaire, ni synovite, l\\'état général est conservé. Les examens complémentaires montrent : VS : 27, CRP : 7 (N<10), Latex : 1/640, waaler-rose 250 (N<30), Ac antipeptides citrullinés positifs : 47 (N<25), absence d\\'AAN, d\\'ANCA, d\\'Ac anti-filagrine. Le typage HLA montre que la patiente est DRB1 04-10. Le prélèvement oculaire est stérile. La scintigraphie osseuse montre une fixation des doigts, des poignets et des pieds. Les radiographies osseuses montrent une déformation en Z du pouce droit, des érosions osseuses rhumatoïdes typiques des têtes métacarpiennes et métatarsiennes. Le diagnostic de polyarthrite rhumatoïde avec KUP est porté et un traitement a débuté par prednisone 1mg/kg/j à dose progressivement dégressive jusqu\\'à 20 mg/ j et par méthotrexate 15mg/semaine. L\\'évolution est très favorable avec disparition des ulcérations et de la perforation oculaire en 2 mois, avec un recul satisfaisant de 6 mois. Discussion. -La KUP est une vascularite rare touchant la cornée, survenant le plus souvent chez des patients atteints de PR sévère non traité. Cette kératite présente un pronostic péjoratif local avec risque de cécité et un pronostic général sévère avec une mortalité avoisinant les 30%. Le traitement repose sur les immunosuppresseurs par voie générale, notamment le cyclophosphamide, et la corticothérapie à fortes doses. Cette observation démontre que la KUP peut être exceptionnellement curable sans séquelles et révéler une atteinte rhumatoïde peu évolutive, sans vascularite systémique. Conclusion. -La kératite ulcérante perforante, lorsqu\\'elle est bilatérale doit faire évoquer une atteinte rhumatoïde, même lorsque l\\'atteinte articulaire est quiescente.

Elle est admise en chirurgie cardiaque pour tamponnade et drainée en urgence. On conclue alors à une péricardite rhumatoïde devant l\\'absence de d\\'étiologie infectieuse ou néoplasique et la forte positivité récente du facteur rhumatoïde à 335 UI/ml. La corticothérapie est intensifiée (3 bolus de 250 mg de méthyl prednisolone puis relais par prednisone à 10 mg/j) et on introduit l\\'azathioprine (50 mg/j). Le méthotrexate n\\'est pas prescrit puisqu\\'elle est infectée par le virus de l\\'hépatite C. Elle s\\'améliore rapidement et sort une semaine après la chirurgie. Trois mois plus tard, elle est admise en urgence pour nouvelle tamponnade. Elle subit un nouveau drainage péricardique, une intensification cortisonée (3 bolus de 500 mg de méthylprednisolone puis relais par prednisone à 1 mg/kg/j) et l\\'azathioprine est augmentée à 100 mg/j. Un mois plus tard, elle est hospitalisée pour péricardite effusive et constrictive authentifiée en échocardiographie, doppler cardiaque et imagerie par résonance magnétique statique et cinétique. On décide alors de tester un traitement par anti-TNF car la patiente refuse la chirurgie. Elle reçoit 25 mg d\\'etanercept 2 fois par semaine en sous-cutané. L\\'amélioration est spectaculaire en 1 semaine, avec disparition complète des oedèmes et du dip-plateau échographique persistant à 9 mois de recul. La constriction péricardique est rare au cours de la PR (200 cas dans la littérature).

Polonovski, CHRU Lille, 59037 Lille cedex, France Le syndrome de Clarkson est une entité rare caractérisée par l\\'association d\\'une hyperperméabilité capillaire le plus souvent paroxystique et d\\'une gammapathie monoclonale. Le traitement en est décevant. Nous rapportons le cas d\\'un patient dont le syndrome de Clarkson a été découvert en 1991. Rapidement, le syndrome d\\'hyperperméabilité capillaire est devenu chronique avec des oedèmes majeurs permanents et une hémoconcentration. Différents traitements se sont révélés inefficaces notamment la théophylline, l\\'aminophylline, la ciclosporine, le cyclophosphamide et enfin l\\'association prednisone et alkéran devant la gammapathie monoclonale cependant bénigne. Finalement, des cures d\\'immunoglobulines (1g/kg/j pendant 2 jours toutes les 4 semaines) ont été entrepris depuis 1995, actuellement sur un port-a-cath. Ces cures permettent au patient de retrouver environ 15 jours après son poids « sec » qui progressivement retourne à son maximum avant la prochaine cure d\\'immunoglobulines. La tendance actuelle est cependant à ce que le poids avant la cure d\\'immunoglobulines soit de plus en plus bas et se rapproche de son poids « sec ». Cette observation est originale du fait de la longueur d\\'évolution de ce syndrome de Clarkson et du fait de l\\'efficacité prolongée et constante des cures d\\'immunoglobulines polyvalentes ce qui n\\'a pas été rapporté à notre connaissance.

Nous rapportons deux observations de MSA associées une leucopénie initiale. Une femme de 29 ans, sans antécédent, est hospitalisée pour fièvre associée à une éruption maculopapuleuse, une odynophagie, des adénopathies cervicales, une kératite, des arthromyalgies. On note une leucopénie à 3100/mm 3 , une lymphopénie à 992/mm 3 , une thrombopénie à 97000/mm 3 , une anémie à 10,2 g/dl d\\'hémoglobine, une cytolyse hépatique (ALAT à 20N) et un syndrome inflammatoire marqué. L\\'enquête infectieuse (hémocultures, ECBU), sérologies virales : hépatites A, B, C, VIH, EBV, CMV, VZV, rubéole, parvovirus B19, entérovirus, arboviroses, hantavirus, leptospirose et les explorations immunologiques sont négatives. Le scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien est normal. Après deux semaines d\\'évolution, la leucopénie disparaît et laisse place à une hyperleucocytose à PN (leucocytes à 17000/mm 3 , PN à 15130/mm 3 ). La ferritinémie atteint 60526 &#956;g/l avec une fraction glycosylée abaissée à huit %. Une corticothérapie permet la disparition de la fièvre et des anomalies biologiques. Une femme de 24 ans, sans antécédent, est hospitalisée pour fièvre hectique avec arthralgies, érythème transitoire, odynophagie, splénomégalie ; leucopénie à 3200/mm 3 , lymphopénie à 310/mm 3 , thrombopénie à 82000/mm 3 , cytolyse hépatique et syndrome inflammatoire.Le bilan infectieux, les sérologies virales et les explorations immunologiques sont négatifs. La ferritinémie est élevée à 1462 &#956;g/l, la fraction glycosylée est à 13 %. Après six jours d\\'évolution, une hyperleucocytose à PN apparaît. Un traitement par AINS permet l\\'amélioration des signes cliniques et biologiques. Une hyperleucocytose est présente chez environ 60 % des patients ayant une MSA. La présence d\\'une leucopénie initiale constatée chez ces deux patientes est un argument pour évoquer le rôle déclenchant d\\'une infection virale. Un syndrome d\\'activation macrophagique transitoire, éventuellement d\\'origine virale, pourrait aussi rendre compte de la leucopénie.Poster 106 Myocardite aiguë fébrile comme première manifestation de la maladie de Still : Comparaison entre l\\'évolution du syndrome inflammatoire et la fonction myocardiaque sous traitement R.

Nous rapportons une nouvelle observation. Observation. -Monsieur S., 70 ans, consultait pour un syndrome cutané en plaques, sclérodermiforme, bilatéral et symétrique, rapidement extensif depuis trois mois. Il était suivi pour une cardiopathie ischémique depuis 10 ans. L\\'examen objectivait une dizaine de placards annulaires, violacés, indurés et pigmentés, mesurant de 3 à 10 cm de diamètre, regroupés en nappes au niveau des grands plis. L\\'histologie cutanée était caractérisée par un infiltrat inflammatoire interstitiel dermique évocateur de DGIP. La radiographie thoracique montrait une opacité lobaire supérieure droite rapportée à un carcinome indifférencié bronchique classé T 2 N 0 M O stade 1. Le traitement comportait une lobectomie avec curage ganglionnaire et une polychimiothérapie. Le recul est insuffisant pour juger de l\\'évolution de la DGIP. Commentaires. -Le tableau clinique de la DGIP est stéréotypé : placards annulaires, mal limités, violacés, bilatéraux et symétriques, mesurant de 3 à 20 cm de diamètre, prédominant sur les faces latérales du tronc et de l\\'abdomen et/ou au niveau des grands plis (Tomasini C. : J Am Acad Dermatol 2002 ; 46 : 892 -9). L\\'évolution se fait parfois sur un mode pigmentaire. Les morphées constituent le principal diagnostic différentiel clinique. Ce syndrome est préférentiellement associé aux affections systémiques auto-immunes (polyarthrite rhumatoïde, LES). Quelques cas sont d\\'origine toxidermique (calcibloqueurs, béta-bloquants). Nous rapportons la deuxième observation où la DGIP révèle un carcinome bronchique (Schreckenberg et al. Ann Dermatol Venereol 1998 ; 125 : 585/8). La DGIP élargit le spectre des réactions inflammatoires interstitielles et/ou granulomateuses potentiellement associées aux maladies systémiques. Sa signification n\\'est pas connue.

Il avait un purpura des membres inférieurs. L\\'examen neurologique était normal, il n\\'y avait pas d\\'organomégalie. Le bilan biologique montrait une fonction rénale normale sans protéinurie. Il existait dans le sérum une IgG kappa monoclonale sans critère de myélome et une cryoglobuline (CG) de type I à 3653 ug/ml. La sérologie de l\\'hépatite C était négative. Le scanner thoracoabdominal était normal. La biopsie d\\'une lésion purpurique ne mettait pas en évidence de cristaux de cryoglobuline. Le patient faisait un nouvel AVC. Un traitement associant des échanges plasmatiques, un bolus d\\'endoxan et une corticothérapie était débuté. Cependant l\\'évolution se faisait vers la bilatéralisation de l\\'atteinte cérébelleuse. Une hémicérebellectomie avec dérivation ventriculaire était effectuée en urgence. Le patient décédait un mois après le début de l\\'hospitalisation, dans un tableau de défaillance multiviscérale. Les manifestations neurologiques des CG les plus fréquentes sont les neuropathies périphériques. Les atteintes centrales sont plus rares et les accidents vasculaires exceptionnels. Bien que nous n\\'ayons pas mis en évidence de cristaux dans le sérum ou la biopsie de peau chez notre patient, la formation d\\'une cryocristaloglobuline nous semble très probable. Le syndrome des cristaux de CG a en effet été décrit au cours des CG de type I et les gammapathies monoclonales. Il se manifeste par des arthrites destructrices, des lésions purpuriques et des atteintes viscérales diffuses. Une vasculopathie cérébrale occlusive, pourrait ainsi expliquer les accidents neurologiques itératifs de notre patient.Poster 110 Nécrose médullaire : à propos de deux cas L. Cheptanaru a , K.

Kheder Service de médecine interne-A, CHU Charles-Nicolle, boulevard du-9-avril, 1007, Tunis, Tunisie Le NITU syndrome associe une néphropathie interstitielle à une uvéite. L\\'uvéite est habituellement antérieure et bilatérale, elle suit le plus souvent l\\'atteinte rénale. La néphropathie est caractérisée sur le plan histologique par un infiltrat lympho-plasmocytaire interstitiel et l\\'absence de lésions glomérulaires.

Ennaifer, M. Smiti Khanfir, I. Ben Ghorbel, M.-H. Houman Service de médecine interne, hôpital la-Rabta, Jebbari, 1007, Tunis, TunisieLa survenue d\\'une névrite optique rétrobulbaire (NORB) est exceptionnelle au cours de la maladie de Behçet et à notre connaissance, seulement une trentaine de cas ont été rapportés. Observation 1. -Patient âgé de 27 ans, suivi pour une maladie de Behçet dont le diagnostic a été retenu devant l\\'association d\\'une aphtose bipolaire, d\\'une pseudofolliculite, d\\'un test pathergique positif et de manifestations neurologiques à type de syndrome pyramidal ainsi que des manifestations psychiatriques. Quatre ans après les premières manifestations de la maladie, le patient se plaignait d\\'un flou visuel. L\\'acuité visuelle était alors à 1/10 à l\\'oeil gauche, 1/20 à l\\'oeil droit, non améliorable, sans uvéite ni vascularite au fond d\\'oeil. L\\'angiographie rétinienne était sans anomalie. Le champ visuel mettait en évidence des scotomes bilatéraux étendus. Le diagnostic de NORB au cours de la maladie de Behçet a été retenu. Le patient a été traité par corticothérapie générale et des cures mensuelles de cyclophosphamide sans amélioration de l\\'acuité visuelle avec un recul actuel de 2 mois. Observation 2. -Patient âgé de 49 ans, suivi pour une maladie de Behçet diagnostiquée devant l\\'association d\\'aphtose bipolaire, de pseudofolliculite, d\\'un test pathergique positif et de manifestations neuropsychiatriques. Le patient se plaignait d\\'une baisse progressive de l\\'acuité visuelle concomitante aux premières manifestations de la maladie. L\\'examen ophtalmologique objectivait une baisse de l\\'acuité visuelle à 6/10 aux deux yeux, non améliorable, sans uvéite ni vascularite rétinienne avec une angiographie rétinienne sans anomalie. Le champ visuel objectivait des scotomes arciformes absolus et des scotomes paracentraux relatifs. Les potentiels évoqués visuels n\\'étaient pas altérés. Le diagnostic de NORB associée à une maladie de Behçet a été retenu. Le patient a été traité par une corticothérapie per os et du cyclophosphamide à raison de six cures mensuelles et deux cures trimestrielles. L\\'évolution a été marquée par une amélioration partielle de l\\'acuité visuelle.\\nObservation. -Femme antillaise de 44 ans hospitalisée en 2003 pour polyarthrite fébrile. Antécédents : embolie pulmonaire à l\\'âge de 20 ans, trois phlébites avant 30 ans. À 30 ans, elle est opérée d\\'un anévrisme de l\\'aorte abdominale : pontage aorto-bi-iliaque avec reprise chirurgicale à l\\'âge de 40 ans (thrombose et anévrisme iliaque). À l\\'entrée : aphtes buccaux et génitaux, arthrites des genoux et des chevilles, C-réactive protéine à 100 mg/l, anémie à 8,8 g/dl, hyperleucocytose, déficit en protéine-S. Douleurs profondes des membres inférieurs : radiographies (appositions périostées) et scintigraphie osseuse (hyperfixation) affirment le syndrome de Pierre Marie (SPM). Le diagnostic de maladie de Behçet (MB) fait traiter la patiente par prednisone, azathioprine, colchicine et anticoagulants. Deux mois plus tard : violente douleur du membre inférieur droit, anémie à 5 g/dl. Le scanner abdominal retrouve une image aérique en regard du greffon iliaque, suggérant une fistule aortodigestive. Hémocultures positives à Entérocoque, E. coli, Lactococcus lactis cremoris et Peptostreptococcus microscopis. Une antibiothérapie à large spectre est débutée. La patiente est alors opérée : pontage axilobifémoral et visualisation d\\'une fistule entre le greffon aortique et le troisième duodénum. La prothèse aorto-bi-iliaque ainsi que le greffon fémoral sont exclus. Les antibiotiques sont poursuivis six semaines associés aux corticoïdes. Neuf mois plus tard : absence de fièvre, le syndrome inflammatoire a disparu, hémoglobine normalisée. Discussion. -Il s\\'agit du deuxième cas décrit de SPM révélant une infection de prothèse au cours d\\'une MB. Un SPM peut révéler une infection de prothèse aorto-bi-iliaque. Outre l\\'antibiothérapie, le traitement passe par le pontage axilo-bifémoral bilatéral et par l\\'exclusion de la prothèse. L\\'association du SPM et d\\'une infection de prothèse n\\'est probablement pas fortuite au cours de la MB, en raison des manifestations anévrismales vasculaires spécifiques et du traitement immunosuppresseur favorisant les infections.

Ollivier Service de médecine interne, CHU Côte de Nacre, avenue de la côte de Nacre, 14033 Caen cedex, France Les principales causes de décès de la maladie de Horton (MH) sont représentées par les infarctus (myocardique, mésentérique), les anévrismes de l\\'aorte et les accidents vasculaires cérébraux. Nous rapportons trois cas de cécité corticale d\\'origine hortonienne dont deux avec autopsie. Homme de 58 ans : MH révélée par une artérite des membres inférieurs. La Biopsie d\\'artère temporale (BAT) était positive. L\\'évolution était marquée par l\\'apparition d\\'une hémiplégie massive suivie en quelques heures d\\'une cécité corticale puis d\\'un coma et du décès. L\\'autopsie découvrait un infarctus ischémique bi-occipital et l\\'histologie des artères cérébrales, des lésions caractéristiques d\\'artérite gigantocellulaire. Femme de 73 ans : MH découverte 3 semaines auparavant à l\\'occasion d\\'une amaurose transitoire. La BAT était positive. La malade était hospitalisée pour une surdité brusque bilatérale suivie d\\'hémiplégie gauche puis d\\'une cécité corticale, d\\'un coma et finalement du décès.

J Am Coll Cardiol. 1988 ;12(4):964-72]. L\\'angioscanner retrouvait alors une aortite de l\\'aorte thoracique et abdominale. La rémission était obtenue sous prednisone. En février 2003, la maladie était considérée comme guérie (CRP<6 mg/L). Les corticoïdes étaient interrompus.En février 2004, La CRP était dosée à 77 mg/L. L\\'angioscanner ne montrait pas de signes d\\'aortite. On découvrait une cavité aérique lobaire supérieure droite avec micronodules pulmonaires. Malgré l\\'absence de preuves bactériologiques (tubages gastriques, LBA), un traitement anti-tuberculeux était instauré. Devant la persistance d\\'une élévation de la CRP (71 mg/L) une tomographie par émission de positons (TEP) au 18 Fluoro 2 Deoxy Glucose (18F-FDG) était réalisée. On retrouvait de discrets renforcements de fixation au niveau de l\\'aorte thoracique ascendante et de l\\'aorte abdominale. Il n\\'existait pas d\\'hyperfixation pulmonaire. La réintroduction d\\'un traitement par prednisone (10 mg/jour) permettait la normalisation de la CRP. L\\'évaluation de l\\'activité de l\\'AT s\\'avère souvent difficile : mauvaise corrélation avec la VS ou la CRP, difficulté de suivi par angiographie.De nouvelles techniques ont donc récemment été évaluées : IRM, ARM et TEP au 18F-FDG. Le 18F-FDG est un radionucléide analogue du glucose. Il s\\'accumule dans les cellules dont le métabolisme est augmenté. Cette accumulation se retrouve dans les cellules malignes mais aussi dans les lésions inflammatoires. L\\'utilisation de la TEP au 18F-FDG permettrait ainsi, de manière non invasive, un diagnostic précoce d\\'AT avec une sensibilité de 92% et une spécificité proche de 100 % [Webb M, et al.. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2004;31(5):627-34]. L\\'aspect des fixations vasculaires semble également être remarquablement corrélé à l\\'activité de la maladie [Webb M, et al.. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2004;31(5):627-34]. Poster 133 Vascularite primitive du système nerveux central : à propos d\\'un cas S. Ketari a , H. Mrabet b , O. Cherif a , F. Boussema a , S.

Bien que les artérioles soient plus volontiers atteintes, les vaisseaux de différents calibres peuvent être touchés. Le tableau clinique associe des céphalées intenses, une altération des fonctions supérieures et des signes déficitaires. Des crises convulsives sont également rapportées. Le diagnostic est confirmé par des anomalies très évocatrices sur l\\'artériographie[2]  et par la biopsie cérébrale et leptoméningée. Le pronostic de cette maladie est sévère. Son traitement, mal codifié, associe des corticoïdes et des immunosuppresseurs.À ce propos nous rapportons une observation rare d\\'un jeune de 39 ans, atteint d\\'une vascularite primitive du système nerveux central. Cette affection est révélée initialement par un accident vasculaire cérébral avec un déficit moteur hémi-corporel droit, une aphasie motrice et la survenue ultérieure de crises convulsives partielles, motrices, homolatérales et subintrantes. Le diagnostic de vascularite cérébrale est fortement suspecté sur les données de l\\'angiographie cérébrale. L\\'enquête étiologique exhaustive est négative. Sous traitement immunosuppresseurs et anti-épileptique, l\\'évolution est partiellement favorable.\\nLa surdité brusque est une pathologie fréquente dont le mécanisme reste débattu. Les surdités brusques bilatérales (SBB) sont rares et parfois associées à des maladies inflammatoires ou auto-immunes.Nous rapportons le cas d\\'une patiente de 45 ans, aux antécédents de primo-infection tuberculeuse traitée, d\\'oedème rétinien du post-partum à bilan normal, chez laquelle apparaissaient des céphalées intenses postérieures inhabituelles, motivant une consultation ophtalmologique et dentaire qui s\\'avéraient normales. Le mois suivant survenaient des douleurs cervicales basses antérieures avec impression d\\'étau maxillaire. Deux semaines plus tard le tableau se complétait d\\'une SBB, isolée sans fièvre, vertige,ou signe oculaire. L\\'audiogramme confirmait une surdité de perception. L\\'I.R.M, objectivait quelques hypersignaux sous-corticaux profonds. L\\'angio-IRM et l\\'échographie cardiaque étaient normales. La VS était à 61 mm, et l\\'alpha 2 à 12,6 g/l. La sérologie de Lyme était négative. Les anticorps anti-nucléaires, anti-ECT étaient négatifs. La biopsie d\\'artère temporale (BAT) révèlait un infiltrat inflammatoire, fait essentiellement de lymphocytes, intéressant la média et les limitantes élastiques interne et externe. Il existait une lésion épithélioïde au contact de la limitante élastique interne.Sous corticoïde 1,5 mg/kg, l\\'évolution se faisait vers une amélioration clinique et audiométrique. La réduction de la corticothérapie s\\'accompagnait de récidives de douleurs maxillaires qui cédaient à l\\'accroissement des doses.Les SBB,associées à un syndrome inflammatoire, peuvent se voir au cours de vascularites touchant les vaisseaux de tout calibre, en particulier au cours de la maladie de Cogan, de la périartérite noueuse et de la maladie de Wegener. Surtout, plusieurs cas de SBB ont été rapportées au cours d\\'artérite temporale, parfois à BAT négative (Saadoun D et al Ann.Med.Interne, 2000 ; 151 : 600-2).Conclusion. -Le bilan d\\'une SBB survenant dans un contexte inflammatoire devrait comprendre une BAT à la recherche d\\'une vascularite.Poster 135Trismus avec artérite temporale révélant une périartérite noueuse.A.

Ses manifestations peuvent être variées : dacryocystite, épisclérite, sclérite, uvéite, pseudo-tumeur inflammatoire. L\\'atteinte chorio-rétinienne au cours de la MW reste cependant rare. Nous rapportons deux nouveaux cas. Cas n o 1. -Une patiente de 53 ans est hospitalisée en raison d\\'un purpura vasculaire, de nécroses digitales, d\\'une baisse d\\'acuité visuelle (BAV) bilatérale associés à un syndrome inflammatoire. L\\'examen ophtalmologique retrouve une occlusion des troncs chorio-rétiniens et des artères centrales de la rétine. Le diagnostic de MW est posé devant la présence d\\'une vascularite leucocytoclasique à la biopsie cutanée et de c-ANCA (1/160 e ) avec anticorps anti-protéinase 3 (Ac anti-PR3) à 135 U/mL. Le traitement initial repose sur des bolus de corticoïdes (CS) et de cyclophosphamide (CYC) sous couvert d\\'une anticoagulation. La survenue d\\'une hémorragie alvéolaire nécessite cinq plasmaphérèses. À l\\'obtention de la rémission complète (RC), l\\'acuité visuelle n\\'est que très partiellement améliorée.Cas n o 2. -Un patient de 63 ans est hospitalisé pour bilan de sinusites, arthralgies, BAV unilatérale et syndrome inflammatoire. Un tableau de glomérulonéphrite rapidement progressive apparaît durant l\\'hospitalisation. L\\'examen ophtalmologique révèle une occlusion de l\\'artère centrale de la rétine à droite. Le diagnostic de MW est retenu sur la présence d\\'une glomérulonéphrite extra-capillaire pauci-immune avec nécrose fibrinoïde. Les ANCA sont de type cytoplasmique avec présence d\\'Ac anti-PR3. Le traitement repose sur l\\'administration de bolus de CS et de CYC associés à la prise d\\'anti-agrégants.

Nous rapportons une exceptionnelle atteinte pancréatique symptomatique. Observation.-Un homme de 68 ans avait depuis 1995 une pan sinusite chronique avec une rhinite croûteuse, des épistaxis et une rhinorrhée postérieure. Il n\\'avait pas d\\'atteinte rénale ni pulmonaire. L\\'histologie sinusienne était celle d\\'une inflammation non spécifique. Les anticorps anti-cytoplasme de polynucléaires neutrophiles étaient à 1/160 avec fluorescence péri nucléaire (pANCA), sans spécificité en ELISA. En juillet 2001, il avait une orchite et une hématurie macroscopique spontanément résolutives. Les explorations étaient négatives. Une corticothérapie orale s\\'avérait inefficace sur les symptômes ORL. En avril 2002, apparaissaient des arthralgies inflammatoires, sans atteinte rénale ni signe digestif. Il n\\'y avait pas de syndrome inflammatoire et les pANCA étaient à 1/320. Un traitement par immunoglobulines (Ig) polyvalentes (6 cures mensuelles) et BACTRIM® permettait une rémission. En juillet 2003, le patient interrompait le BACTRIM®. En novembre 2003, les signes ORL réapparaissaient isolément avec des pANCA à 1/160. Il s\\'améliorait avec la reprise des Ig et du BACTRIM®. À la 5 e cure d\\'Ig, apparaissait un ictère à bilirubine conjuguée. L\\'échographie, le scanner et l\\'IRM montraient une dilatation des voies biliaires intra et extra hépatiques sans obstacle visible.

L\\'Ac anti-Jo-1 (AcJo1) représente 20 à 35 % des cas. Nous rapportons un cas de SAS à Ac anti-PL7, dont le diagnostic et le traitement ont été retardé de près de deux ans en raison de la négativité des AcJo1. La maladie débutait deux ans avant le diagnostic, par une toux isolée. Le tableau s\\'enrichissait d\\'un SIP prédominant aux bases, de douleurs musculaires invalidantes, de l\\'exacerbation d\\'un Raynaud, d\\'une perte de 20 kg, d\\'un syndrome inflammatoire et d\\'une cytolyse musculaire modérés. Les AcJo1 étaient négatifs à deux reprises. Finalement une biopsie musculaire montrait une M sévère, particulière par la localisation septale des infiltrats lymphohistiocytaires. Une recherche d\\'Ac en service spécialisé était positive à 1/1280 de spécificité PL7(immunodot). La mise sous corticoïdes faisait disparaître les symptômes. Le SAS à PL 7 ne représente que 2 à 5 % des SAS. Il associe, une dermatomyosite et des atteintes articulaires sévères (Imbert-Masseau A et al. Joint Bone Spine 2003; 70: 161-8). Notre cas se rapprochait plus cliniquement d\\'un SAS à AcJo1. L\\'absence de test de routine pour la recherche des autres Ac a retardé le diagnostic. En dehors de l\\'immunodot, la technique d\\'immuno-empreinte pourrait représenter une méthode de dépistage (Charlannes H et al ; Rev Med Interne 2004 ; 25 : S77). Devant un tableau compatible avec un SAS, la négativité des AcJo1 doit faire rechercher les autres Ac de type ami-noacyltRNA synthétases. Poster 145 Efficacité du rituximab dans une polymyosite avec syndrome des anti-synthétases O. Lambotte, R. Kobt, G. Maigne, F.X. Blanc, J.F. Delfraissy, C. Goujard Service de médecine interne, CHU du Kremlin Bicêtre, 78, rue du général Leclerc, 94275 Le Kremlin Bicêtre, France Le rituximab (Mabthera*) est un anticorps monoclonal anti-CD20 dont l\\'efficacité a été montrée au cours de plusieurs maladies auto-immunes. Les données concernant les immunothérapies au cours des myosites inflammatoires sont rares [Levine TD. Arthritis Rheum 2002 S489]. Nous rapportons le premier cas d\\'efficacité du rituximab pour traiter une patiente atteinte d\\'une polymyosite sévère avec syndrome des anti-synthétases.En 1998, une femme de 47 ans, infirmière sans antécédent, est hospitalisée pour une faiblesse des quatre membres et des polyarthralgies. L\\'examen clinique montre un aspect de « mains de travailleur ». Il existe un syndrome interstitiel, les CPK sont à 3N, la recherche d\\'anticorps anti-Jo-1 est positive. La biopsie musculaire confirme le diagnostic de polymyosite. Un traitement par prednisone (1 mg/kg) est débuté avec une amélioration nette mais la patiente devient cortico-dépendante à moins de 25 mg/jour. Elle est incapable de retravailler. En 2000, un traitement par Méthotrexate est inefficace et l\\'essai de l\\'azathioprine se solde par une agranulocytose. En 2001, les immunoglobulines intraveineuses (IgIV) sont débutées avec une nette efficacité permettant de réduire la corticothérapie à 15 mg/j mais l\\'efficacité des IgIV s\\'épuise progressivement fin 2002 conduisant à une dose de prednisone de 30 mg/jour. En Septembre 2003, le déficit musculaire est coté à 9 sur l\\'échelle fonctionnelle ([Herson S et coll. Arthritis Rheum 1995;38:S168) et les CPK deviennent supérieures à 1000UI. La patiente reçoit alors quatre doses de rituximab. L\\'efficacité est nette avec, quatre mois plus tard, un score fonctionnel à 2 et des CPK normalisées. Un an plus tard, la dose de prednisone est réduite à 9 mg/jour et la patiente a pu reprendre son travail. L\\'anti-Jo-1 reste positif, la situation pulmonaire est stable.Cette observation suggère l\\'efficacité du rituximab dans le syndrome des anti-synthétases. L\\'immunité humorale est donc probablement impliquée dans la physiopathologie de ce syndrome en liaison avec l\\'immunité T CD8 qui est habituellement mise en avant dans les polymyosites.Poster 146 Une dermatomyosite hypomyopathique révélatrice d\\'un lymphome T gamma delta M.O.

Couret, E. Arlet-Suau Service de médecine interne, CHU Purpan, 1, place du Dr Baylac, 31059 Toulouse cedex, France Une patiente de 63 ans est traitée en 1999 pour un thymome malin par chirurgie et radiothérapie, sans rechute au cours de la surveillance. En octobre 2003, elle présente des lésions cutanées, des arthrites des chevilles, genoux et poignets associées à une épisclérite de l\\'oeil gauche. Les lésions dermatologiques sont des papulo-pustules non prurigineuses palmaires et autour des chevilles ainsi que des papules érythémateuses des genoux. Le bilan biologique retrouve une lymphopénie, un important syndrome inflammatoire, un anticoagulant circulant, une insuffisance rénale modérée avec une hématurie et protéinurie à 0.51 g par 24 heures. Les anticorps antinucléaires sont à 1/2500 sans anti-ENA. Les anti-ADN sont négatifs en Farr mais positifs sur Crithidia luciliae. Les ANCA sont positifs, de type p avec des anti-MPO à 110 UI/L. La radiographie thoracique est normale et le TDM thoracique montre l\\'absence de récidive du thymome mais la présence d\\'un épanchement pleural gauche modéré. La biopsie de peau retrouve un infiltrat polymorphe sans signe de vascularite, ni de signe de dermatose neutrophilique. Le diagnostic de lupus systémique est posé et une corticothérapie est instituée permettant une amélioration rapide des lésions cutanées et du syndrome inflammatoire. La diminution de la corticothérapie est diminuée progressivement sans récidive après l\\'introduction d\\'hydroxychloroquine.Discussion. -L\\'association d\\'un lupus systémique et d\\'un thymome est rare. Une quarantaine de cas seulement sont rapportés dans la littérature. Une fois sur deux, ils sont diagnostiqués simultanément. Le lupus précède le diagnostic du thymome dans environ 20 % des cas avec un délai de un à dix ans.

Nous rapportons un cas où les immunoglobulines intraveineuses (IgIV) ont apporté un bénéfice indiscutable. Une jeune femme de 27 ans, est suivie depuis 1998 pour un LED, ayant débuté par une fièvre, des arthralgies, une néphropathie lupique classe OMS IIb, un acrosyndrome et une atteinte cutanée. Si la plupart des symptômes ont été contrôlés par une corticothérapie par voie générale, l\\'atteinte dermatologique reste sévère : celle-ci affecte le visage mais surtout les quatre extrémités et en particulier les faces palmaires et plantaires, sous forme de multiples plaques érythémateuses légèrement squameuses, par endroit atrophique, et surtout très douloureuses la gênant dans ses activités quotidiennes, les gestes fins des mains et entravant la marche. Le traitement par corticoïdes (locaux et par voie générale) est décevant, malgré l\\'adjonction de Plaquenil®. Un traitement par Thalidomide, 150 mg/jour n\\'apporte qu\\'un résultat médiocre et se complique d\\'un début de neuropathie. Un traitement par IgIV est alors débuté à la dose de 2 g/kg par cure tous les mois. Au 3 e mois, une amélioration est notée, qui devient plus évidente au 4 e mois, avec une nette amélioration au visage et aux mains, et une disparition quasi complète des lésions de la voûte plantaire.. Conclusion. -Ces résultats montrent que les IgIV peuvent être un traitement alternatif intéressant des atteintes cutanées sévères du LED, et peuvent permettre d\\'éviter le recours aux immuno-suppresseurs.

Un LA n\\'apparaît jamais à plus de 3 mois de la TV. APL :un taux faible (> 10UGPL) est présent chez 4 patients à M0, persistant à un an chez deux patients, disparaissant à M3 chez 1 patient et à M6 chez 1 patient.

L\\'hémogramme, les fonctions hépatique et rénale, les enzymes musculaires étaient normaux. L\\'histologie d\\'une lésion de purpura montrait une inflammation périvasculaire et une thrombose fibrinoïde sans vascularite; il n\\'y avait pas d\\'inclusion virale.

À noter la positivité identique de la serologie PVB19 en IgM et en IgG chez l\\'épouse de ce patient confimant la précesssion de l\\'infection à PVB19. La principale originalité de cette observation est la mise en évidence d\\'une varicelle dans les suites d\\'une PI à PVB19. La polyarthrite aigüe est la manifestation la plus connue de la PI à PVB19 de l\\'adulte jeune. Les myalgies sont moins fréquentes [Cathébras et al Rev Med Int 2000,21: 324]. La présentation cutanée sous forme de purpura fébrile des membres inférieurs est habituelle et expliquée par le tropisme du virus pour les cellules endothéliales.

Sa mère avait souffert d\\'une thrombose veineuse profonde. L\\'examen physique était normal. Il existait un syndrome mononucléosique biologique, des transaminases à 3 N avec une cholestase. L\\'échographie et le scanner ont montré une thrombose de la branche portale droite. La sérologie CMV était positive en Ig M et l\\'antigénémie CMV positive; les autres causes d\\'hépatite aigüe ont été éliminées. Le bilan de thrombose était négatif.

Le CMV a un tropisme endothélial ; il favorise l\\'activité procoagulante de l\\'endothélium par différents mécanismes (relargage tissulaire de facteur von Willebrand, augmentation des molécules d\\'adhésion, mécanisme auto-immun…) [Kazory A et al.Transplantation 2004 ; 77 : 597-9]. Des co-facteurs sont nécessaires à l\\'expression de cette action pro-thrombogène, comme le tabac et la contraception orale chez notre patiente [J.L. Estival et al. Presse Med 2001 ; 30 :1876-8].

Son implication a été démontrée dans les thyroïdites auto-immunes [Masuda M et al Clin Endocrinol 1996;45:461-6]. Mais l\\'association de cette triade : HTLV-1-pathologie auto-immune thyroïdienne et uvéite est une entité peu connue, encore moins en zone non-endémique. Cas n o 1. -Patiente de 45 ans d\\'origine ivoirienne. Ses antécédents sont une hyperthyroïdie avec exophtalmie depuis dix ans sous anti-thyroïdien de synthèse (carbimazole). L\\'atteinte ophtalmologique remonte à quatre ans avec une uvéite bilatérale (antérieure, granulomateuse à droite et totale à gauche) avec corps flottant du vitré et vascularite à l\\'angiographie. Le bilan immunologique est en faveur de l\\'origine auto-immune de l\\'hyperthyroïdie avec anticorps anti-thyroperoxydase à 1770 UI/l (nl<60).Cas n o 2. -Patiente de 56 ans d\\'origine haïtienne présente simultanément une panuvéite ainsi qu\\'une maladie de Basedow. L\\'examen ophtalmologique montre une panuvéite secondairement bilatérale, chronique, non granulomateuse, synéchiante avec des corps flottant du vitré. Le bilan immunologique montre la présence d\\'anticorps anti-recepteurs de la TSH à 127,3 UI/l (nl<2).Dans les deux cas, la sérologie HTLV-1 positive a été confirmée en Western blot, et PCR.L\\'évolution ophtalmologique dans les deux cas sera favorable sous simple corticothérapie topique avec récupération de l\\'acuité visuelle à 10/10.Les malades n\\'avaient pas d\\'autre atteinte viscérale liées à HTLV-1.Une thyroïdite et parfois décrite chez les malades atteints d\\'uvéite HTLV-1, dans les grandes séries japonaises.

Dans ce contexte la présentation peut être trompeuse et retarder d\\'autant le diagnostic et le traitement antiviral. Ainsi des douleurs abdominales et/ou un SIADH peuvent précéder de plusieurs jours (jusqu\\'à 3 semaines) l\\'éruption cutanée classique. Nous rapportons un cas survenu chez une patiente autogreffée. Une femme de 50 ans est admise pour vomissements et douleurs épigastriques intenses évoluant depuis trois jours. Dix mois plus tôt elle a été autogreffée pour une leucémie aiguë (LAM4). La sérologie VZV était positive (IgG) avant la greffe. L\\'examen clinique est sans particularité (abdomen souple, ni fièvre, ni signes neurologiques, ni rash). Biologiquement on note: natrémie 123 mmol/L, natriurèse 130 mmol/jour, transaminases et LDH 1,5xN, plaquettes 110000/mm 3 . Le LCR est normal ainsi que les autres explorations (gastroscopie, échographie et TDM abdominales, TDM cérébrale, radiographie thoracique). Les douleurs nécessitent rapidement l\\'utilisation de morphine IV alors que les perturbations hépatiques et hématologique se majorent (ASAT 112 U/L, ALAT 166 U/L, GGT 1150 U/L, ALP 856 U/L, LDH 650 U/L, plaquettes 22000/mm 3 ). Au quatrième jour apparaît une éruption cutanée vésiculeuse (tronc, face, cuir chevelu). Devant la suspicion d\\'infection à VZV un traitement par acyclovir IV est débuté, suivi par la disparition des douleurs en 24 h. La biologie s\\'améliore progressivement et on note l\\'apparition d\\'IgM anti-VZV. À notre connaissance la triade douleurs abdominales-SIADH-infection à VZV a été rapportée une seule fois après autogreffe et 4 fois après allogreffe. Les douleurs semblent liées à la diffusion du VZV aux organes abdominaux (oesophagite, gastrite, hépatite et pancréatite à VZV) par le biais de leur innervation sympathique (assurée par la racine D7 droite). Le mécanisme du SIADH n\\'est pas connu. Le diagnostic peut être posé avant l\\'éruption en recherchant par PCR le VZV dans le sang (de Jong MD, Lancet 2001). Ceci permet un traitement rapide et évite le recours à des procédures diagnoctiques (laparotomie) ou thérapeutiques inutiles.

L\\'analyse a été effectuée via un automate ADVIA 120 (Bayer) à J0 (admission), J1, J2 et J5.\\n. -Dans une étude récente, Kaminsky et al insistaient sur le fait qu\\'une infection bactérienne pouvait être raisonnablement exclue si le taux de neutrophiles est < à 7000/mm³ associés à un taux de lymphocytes > à 1200/mm³ et d\\'éosinophiles > 100/mm³. Dans notre étude, aucun patient présentant une infection bactérienne documentée n\\'avait ce profil à l\\'admission. Cependant, à J1, deux patients avaient ce profil leucocytaire et la proportion passait à 12 et 22 patients respectivement à J2 et J5.

L\\'évolution à 5 ans de l\\'état de santé de sujets HGM lors d\\'un examen à l\\'IRSA a été étudiée. Des facteurs prédictifs d\\'évolution vers un diabète ont été recherchés. Antécédents personnels et familiaux, données biométriques, comportements et traitements ont été recueillis chez 743 hommes (âge 23-59 ans). Dosages biologiques réalisés à jeun. Analyses de covariances et régressions logistiques utilisées avec ajustement pour l\\'âge et l\\'IMC. HGM trouvée chez 8% des hommes (743/9314) lors du 1er examen de santé. Cinq ans plus tard, 44% de ces sujets euglycémiques, 39% toujours avec HGM et 17% devenus diabétiques. Facteurs de risque plus fréquents chez les sujets devenus diabétiques que chez les sujets ayant normalisé leur glycémie: antécédent familial de diabète ou personnel d\\'HTA, tabagisme, faible activité physique, mauvaises habitudes alimentaires (absence de petit déjeuner, moindre consommation de produits laitiers, excès de boissons alcoolisées). IMC plus élevé chez les sujets devenus diabétiques ainsi que triglycérides, hémoglobine et hématocrite. Malgré réduction du tabagisme et activité physique plus fréquente, 17% des sujets HGM sont devenus diabétiques cinq ans plus tard. Par rapport à ceux ayant normalisé leur glycémie, pratique d\\'un sport en moindre augmentation chez HGM et oubli du petit déjeuner non corrigé. Il s\\'agissait des sujets gardant IMC et tour de taille les plus élevés.\\nDiabète de type 2 et alimentation : influence pour 80 patients du type de suivi médical C. Halloin, V. Lesire, R.

Sur les 547 EE réalisées, 55 concernent le dépistage de l\\'IMS chez le DT2 à haut risque, asymptomatique à ECG de repos normal.Résultats. -Ces 55 EE se décomposent en 18 EE maximales négatives, 4 fortement positives, 12 faiblement positives ou douteuses, 21 sous maximales. Sur les 4 patients avec EE fortement positive, 2 ont bénéficié d\\'une coronarographie suivie d\\'une angioplastie ou d\\'un pontage ; les 2 autres patients à EE fortement positive n\\'ont pas eu de coronarographie, un traitement médical anti-ischémique à été instauré.Parmi les12 patients à EE faiblement positive, 3 ont eu une scintigraphie ou une échographie de stress, 9 n\\'ont pas eu d\\'autre exploration, le traitement médical a été débuté pour 7 d\\'entre eux. Sur les 21 EE sous maximales, la durée de l\\'EE a été supérieure à 440 secondes pour 13 d\\'entre elles, ne justifiant pas d\\'exploration supplémentaire, 8 ont duré moins de 440 secondes, seules 3 ont été suivi d\\'une scintigraphie ou d\\'une échographie de stress.Conclusion. -Trente neuf patients (70,9 %) ont eu une stratégie de dépistage de l\\'IMS en accord avec les recommandations SFC/ALFEDIAM 2004. L\\'EE reste l\\'examen de choix pour le dépistage de l\\'IMS, à condition d\\'être maximale et démaquillée. Dans le cas contraire, il faut recourir aux tests mixtes, scintigraphie ou échographie de stress. Prévalence et profil de la neuropathie chez les diabétiques vus en hôpital de jour F.

Belhadj Service de médecine interne, EHU 1 er -novembre-54, cité Grande-Terre, bâtiment-A n o 202, 31000 Oran, Algérie L\\'objectif de cette étude est d\\'estimer la prévalence de la neuropathie diabétique et définir son profil clinique dans une population de diabétiques recrutés à partir de l\\'hôpital de jour. Patients et Méthodes. -Cette étude a concerné 310 sujets diabétiques, répartis en 138 diabétiques de type-1 et 172 de type-2. Il s\\'agit de 165 femmes et 145 hommes. Tous ces patients ont fait l\\'objet d\\'un examen neurologique minutieux précisant les signes fonctionnels et les manifestations dysautonomiques, d\\'un bilan des autres complications du diabète, un bilan des facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire (FRCV), un dosage de la glycémie et de l\\' HbA1c.Résultats. -La prévalence de la neuropathie périphérique est de 33,3 %, plus élevée dans le diabète de type-2 (42,4 %) vs (21,7 %) dans le diabète de type 1(P<0,001). La fréquence des symptômes de dysautonomie est similaire dans les deux types de diabète (26,1 %). Il s\\'agit d\\'une vessie neurogène (7,8 %), d\\'une gastroparésie (5,8 %), 3,8 % ne reconnaissent pas les signes d\\'alarme de l\\'hypoglycémie. La neuropathie cardiaque est présente chez 39,7 % des sujets. La neuropathie périphérique est plus fréquente que la rétinopathie (25,8 %) et la néphropathie(19,4 %) mais elle est associée de façon significative (P<0,001) et a précédé ces complications dans plus de la moitié des cas. Sa fréquence augmente avec l\\'âge et la durée d\\'évolution du diabète. Elle est aussi associée à l\\'hypertension artérielle chez 39% des sujets et à l\\'artérite des membres inférieurs dans 10,7 % des cas.Conclusion. -Cette étude rapporte une prévalence élevée de la neuropathie, décrite dans la population maghrébine et souligne la nécessité de renforcer l\\'équilibre glycémique [DCCT, N Engl J Med 1993 ;359 :977-985], de réaliser un dépistage précoce au stade infraclinique afin d\\'identifier très tôt les sujets à risque de lésions du pied et à risque de mortalité [Mayfield JA et al.

Mild cobalamine deficiency associated with long-term metformine intake-reply.J.Intern.Décrite il y a 20 ans, rare et bénigne, la mastopathie diabétique (MD) s\\'observe le plus souvent chez des femmes préménopausiques, atteintes d\\'un diabète de type 1 (DID) ancien, compliqué de manifestations dégénératives microangiopathiques[Bouté V et al. J Le Sein, 2003 ; 13 : 261-9]. L\\'observation que nous rapportons en souligne les principales caractéristiques. Une femme de 32 ans, atteinte d\\'un DID depuis l\\'âge de 7 ans, multicompliqué (rétinopathie, neuropathie, néphropathie) consulte pour de nombreuses tuméfactions dures, indolores des 2 seins sans adénopathie axillaire. Les examens d\\'imagerie (échographie, mammographie, IRM) ne mettent pas en évidence d\\'image suspecte d\\'un cancer du sein. La biopsie transcutanée à l\\'aiguille conclut au diagnostic de MD. La situation clinique est stable après 2 ans de recul. La MD a une définition histologique fondée par l\\'association d\\'une fibrose chéloïde, d\\'un infiltrat lymphocytaire (périlobulaire, péricanalaire et périvasculaire) et de fibroblastes d\\'aspect épithéloïde. Sa pathogénie suggère une implication discutable de l\\'hyperglycémie chronique dans son développement dans la mesure où cette affection a été décrite en dehors du diabète, en contexte de dysimmunité[Grange C et al. Rev Med Interne 2002 ; 23 : 144]. Les réflexions nosologiques les plus récentes reposant sur les analyses cytologiques et immunohistochimiques en font une « pseudotumeur inflammatoire », à intégrer au cadre récemment redéfini des tumeurs myofibroblastiques inflammatoires dont l\\'origine auto-immune, infectieuse ou tumorale reste discutée [Guillou L et al. Ann Pathol 2002 ; 22 : 437-9]. Évolution de la prescription du traitement anti-agrégant plaquettaire chez le diabétique de type 2 hypertendu G. Fradet, C. Michaud Service de médecine interne-diabétologie, CHD multisite Laroche-sur-yon-Luçon-Montaigu, site de Luçon, rue Renaud, 85407 Luçon cedex, France Introduction. -La prescription d\\'une petite dose d\\'aspirine à visée anti-agrégante a fait la preuve de son intérêt dans la prévention cardiovasculaire. Ceci est notamment vrai chez le diabétique de type-2 (DT2) en prévention primaire et secondaire de l\\'ischémie coronaire. L\\'AFSSAPS recommande l\\'aspirine à la dose de 75 à 160 mg chez le DT2, hypertendu [Traitement médicamenteux du diabète de type-2. Recommandations de bonne pratique.Février 1999] ainsi que la Société Française de Cardiologie et l\\'ALFEDIAM [Charbonnel B et al. Arch Mal Coeur 2004; 97: 338-357]. Méthode. -Évaluation de la présence d\\'un anti-agrégant plaquettaire (AAP) dans le traitement des DT2 vus en consultation ou en hôpital de jour sur une année. Résultats. -Sur 401 DT2, 316 sont hypertendus traités (78,8%), 85 non hypertendus dont 19 avec un AAP justifié par une artérite pour 8 d\\'entre eux. Parmi les 316 DT2, hypertendus, 164 ont une insuffisance coronarienne et/ou une artérite justifiant leur traitement AAP (n = 143)ou anti-vitamine K (n = 21), mais 6 n\\'ont aucun traitement AAP ou anti-vitamine K dont 3 pour des raisons de contre-indication.Les 152 autres patients sont DT2, hypertendus, sans macro-angiopathie avérée:12 sont sous traitement AVK pour autre raison (fibrillation…), 3 ont stoppé le traitement AAP pour complications (hémorragie).Finalement sur 137 patients restants, 51 n\\'ont pas de traitement AAP, 86 (62,8 %) prennent un AAP : clopidogrel (n = 3),aspirine entre 75 et 160 mg (n = 80), aspirine au delà de 250 mg (n = 3). Analyse. -La prescription d\\'un traitement AAP chez le DT2 hypertendu semble s\\'améliorer avec 62,8 % des patients traités. Ils étaient 42 % dans l\\'audit n 2 de l\\'étude DIASTEP réalisé en 2001 [Varroud-Vial M et al. Diabetes Metab 2003;29:1S78].Mais 57 % des 86 DT2 sous AAP avaient été vus dans les deux années précédentes en consultation diabétologique, le traitement AAP a donc été instauré spontanément par le médecin traitant seulement dans 43 % des cas.A l\\'inverse, dans le groupe des patients non traités, 90 % n\\'avaient jamais bénéficié d\\'une consultation diabétologique. L\\'aspirine reste sous-utilisée chez le diabétique,elle doit être plus fréquemment prescrite.Son rapport bénéfice/ risque est largement favorable pour un coût moindre.

La biopsie musculaire a mis en évidence de nombreuses fibres rouges déchiquetées, avec à l\\'analyse moléculaire, une délétion touchant 60% des molécules d\\'ADN mitochondrial. Cette observation illustre la nécessité de rechercher une maladie systémique, et notamment une cytopathie mitochondriale, lorsqu\\'à un diabète sont associées des manifestations cliniques inhabituelles, et particulièrement neurologiques ou musculaires.

Le diagnostic posé par le médecin traitant était celui d\\'un eczéma surinfecté par une mycose, mais l\\'association dermocorticoïde-Triflucan se révéla sans effet à 15 jours. 5 mois plus tard les lésions se sont étendues au dos et au visage, avec apparition d\\'une glossite et d\\'une asthénie avec perte de 5 kg. Dans le service, on trouve des plaques érythémateuses, suintantes, à extension centrifuge avec collerette desquamative en périphérie ainsi que de multiple lésions pigmentées du visage séquellaires de lésions anciennes. Par ailleurs il existe une glossite douloureuse et une perlèche bilatérale.

Une étude rétrospective et prospective descriptive a été menée dans le service de médecine interne au CHU du Point-G de janvier 1995 en juin 2001. Vingt-neuf patients sur 800 (3.62 ) malades âgés de 16 à 69 ans ont été ainsi recensés dont 14 hommes et 15 femmes. L\\'âge moyen était de 38 ans. Les patients présentaient à l\\'examen clinique, une asthénie (100 ) ; une anorexie\\n, l\\'insuffisance surrénale était idiopathique. Au cours de l\\'évolution, plus de la moitié de nos patients était décédée : 55,16 % (16/29). Chez 34,5 % (10/29), un traitement substitutif a été instauré et 10,34 % (3/29) étaient perdus de vue. L\\'insuffisance surrénale jadis rare devient de plus en plus fréquente et est souvent associée au VIH.Infundibuloneurohypophysite : un diagnostic difficile P. Pierre a , C. Chabrolle a , M.

Ce diagnostic fait éliminer d\\'autres causes de DI avec parfois preuve histologique. Nous rapportons un cas avec évolution typique de l\\'imagerie hypophysaire sans corticothérapie Fille de 17 ans consulte pour polyurie brutale (12 l/ j) avec polydipsie et asthénie matinale. Cycles réguliers. Glycémie à jeun, TSH, FT4 normales. Diabète insipide central confirmé et traitement par DDAVP institué. A l\\'IRM, épaississement de la tige hypophysaire intéressant l\\'infundibulum et absence de signal hyperintense en T1, antéhypophyse normale (Fig.1). Dosages normaux avec diminution modérée du CLU et de l\\'IGF1. Diagnostics exclus (tuberculose, sarcoïdose, histiocytose, gliome or germinome) : cuti, ACE, calcémie N. LCS: protéines 0,33 g/l avec 2 lymphocytes/mm 3 sans cellules anormales. Culture négative. ACE, AFP et hCG normaux. Radios de thorax et osseuses et scanner thoracique normal de même que la fibroaspiration avec biopsies. En quelques semaines, aménorrhée secondaire avec prise de 8 Kg sans anomalie hormonale. Crainte d\\'un gliome: biopsie de la tige par craniotomie: infiltration lymphocytaire T diffuse et périvasculaire avec cellules CD3+ avec quelques cellules EMA et CD20 +; aucune cellule tumorale; pas de granulome epithélioïde. Surveillance endocrinienne sans autre traitement que DDAVP et court traitement d\\'hydrocortisone. 6 mois plus tard, à l\\'IRM normalisation de la tige avec persistance de l\\'absence d\\'image de posthypophyse (fig.2). Le retour des cycles réguliers est resté associé avec le diabète insipide. 18 mois plus tard, état clinique satisfaisant. En dehors des difficultés diagnostiques, jeune âge et régression rapide et complète de la lésion sans corticothérapie doivent être soulignées. Mécanismes de cette maladie auto-immunitaire indiscutable et sa disparition restent inconnus. Devant un DI apparemment idiopathique + épaississement de la tige, diagnostic de INH à évoquer. IRM à refaire 6 mois plus tard. Suivi prolongé nécessaire car d\\'autres maladies auto-immunes peuvent apparaître.Hyperthyroïdie : une cause rare d\\'hypertension artérielle pulmonaire réversible C. Andrès, A. Demachy, A.-L. Laplaud, Y. Ollivier, A. Zoulim, P. Letellier Service de médecine interne, CHU, de Côte-de-Nacre, avenue côte-de-Nacre, 14033 Caen cedex, France La tachycardie et les troubles du rythme s\\'observent fréquemment au cours de la Maladie de Basedow, l\\'hypertension artérielle pulmonaire (HTAP) est plus rare et souvent méconnue. Cas clinique. -Une femme de 75 ans est hospitalisée pour oedème des membres inférieurs bilatéral évoluant depuis 1 mois accompagné d\\'asthénie et d\\'une perte de 5 Kgs. Elle se plaint d\\'une dyspnée à l\\'effort d\\'apparition récente. A la biologie, la créatininémie est à 65 µmol/l, le bilan hépatique est normal, la ferritine est élevée à 532 µg/l. LA TSH ultrasensible est abaissée (0.019 µUI/l), les anticorps anti-thyroglobuline et antiperoxydase sont absents, les anticorps anti-récepteurs de la TSH (TSI) sont élevés à un titre de 26.3 UI/l signant une Maladie de Basedow [J.W. Chu et al ; Chest, November 1, 2002 ; 122(5) : 1668-1673].Le rythme cardiaque est sinusal, l\\'écho-doppler veineux des membres inférieurs réalisé en première intention exclut une thrombose veineuse profonde, la scintigraphie pulmonaire de ventilation et de perfusion ne découvre aucun signe d\\'embolie pulmonaire. L\\'échographie doppler cardiaque révèle une hypertension artérielle pulmonaire : PAPS élevée à 53-58 mmHg avec augmentation de la pression auriculaire droite à 15-20 mmHg (veine cave inférieure dilatée de plus de 2 cm de diamètre). Après correction de l\\'hyperthyroïdie par anti-thyroïdien, on constate une normalisation de l\\'hémodynamique pulmonaire : PAPS 30 mmd\\'Hg après 3 mois de traitement. Des cas d\\'HTAP ont été décrits chez des patients atteints de la Maladie de Basedow. Celle-ci régresse généralement après normalisation de la fonction thyroïdienne.3 mécanismes physiopathologiques ont été incriminés : la dysfonction endothéliale, le haut débit cardiaque et les phénomènes auto-immunitaires. La littérature rapporte de nombreux cas d\\'HTAP au cours de la Maladie de Basedow [Inaam A. Nakchbandi et al ; Chest. 1999 ; 116 : 1483-1485]. Il s\\'agit principalement de cas isolés. L\\'HTAP est réversible avec le traitement ; c\\'est là son intérêt.Les HTAP réversibles sont rares en dehors de l\\'embolie pulmonaire dans sa phase aiguë, du béri-béri cardiaque, de certaines connectivites (Horton, Lupus avec syndrome des antiphospholipides associé).Hyperthyroïdie traitée et « Hungry bone syndrome »A.

Br J Surg 1997 ; 84 (1) : 95-7). Un tel désordre s\\'observe aussi après traitement médical (Grieff M Ann Intern Med 2003 ; 139 (8) : 706-7). La calcémie se corrige en quelques mois après supplémentation en calcium. Il paraît donc logique de surveiller systématiquement la calcémie lors du traitement des hyperthyroïdies. Les différentes causes peuvent s\\'associer d\\'où la nécessité d\\'une enquête complète.Observation. -Madame S. née en 1968 présente en novembre 2002 une dysphonie faisant découvrir une masse thyroïdienne (cytoponction : cancer médullaire de la thyroïde [CMT]). La recherche du proto-oncogène RET est négative ainsi que le bilan d\\'extension. La patiente est opérée : thyroïdectomie totale + curage ganglionnaire cervical bilatéral. Les ganglions sont massivement envahis. La chirurgie n\\'a pu être in sano. Une radiothérapie cervicomédiastinale complémentaire est réalisée. A partir de novembre 2003 apparaissent des métastases mammaires, pulmonaires centimétriques, des ganglions médiastinaux., parallèlement à une augmentation du taux de thyrocalcitonine. En l\\'absence de caractère menaçant des lésions, la patiente est simplement surveillée. En mars 2004, elle décrit des symptômes visuels (impression de tâche lumineuse dans l\\'oeil droit, baisse de l\\'acuité visuelle, flou visuel) et des céphalées. L\\'examen clinique ne montre pas de trouble de l\\'oculomotricité. Le réflexe photo-moteur est conservé. L\\'examen neurologique est normal. L\\'IRM cérébrale montre une dissémination cérébrale métastatique avec notamment une lésion occipitale droite. L\\'examen ophtalmologique note un scotome bilatéral et découvre plusieurs métastases choroïdiennes bilatérales. Une radiothérapie encéphalique totale et des choroïdes permettra un très bon contrôle des manifestations visuelles persistant jusqu\\'à septembre 2004. Les métastases choroïdiennes des CMT sont très rares avec un seul cas (CMT au cour d\\'une néoplasie endocrinienne multiple) décrit dans la littérature (Shields JA et al. Am J Ophtalmol, 2003 ; 136 : 775). L\\'observation que nous rapportons est le premier cas de métastases choroïdiennes de CMT dans sa forme sporadique.\\n1] Jubault V, De Lacroix-Szmania I, Zittoun J, Jouault H, Lesprit P, et al.\\n1] Marsh RD, Killeen RB Jr, Agaliotis D. SSW) est beaucoup plus rare[1]. Nous rapportons le cas d\\'un patient de 65 ans suivi pour un myélome multiple de type IgA, révélé par des localisations osseuses multiples et traité pendant un an par des cures mensuelles de melphalan-prednisolone. Il n\\'a jamais eu de facteurs de croissance hématopoïétique.Alors que le patient était en aplasie médullaire, il a presenté une éruption cutanée faite de placards erythémateux étendus,parfois à contours purpurique, non prurigineux,touchant les membres et l\\'abdomen[Figure]. Le patient est resté apyretique. L\\'histologie montre un derme oedématié avec un infiltrat neutophile et sans vascularite. Il n\\'y avait pas de localisation extra cutanée.La corticothérapie n\\'a pas été efficace et le patient est décédé de complications infectieuses. Les lésions cutanées les plus décrites dans le myélome sont : plasmocytome cutané, amylose, vascularite leucocytoclasique,pustulose sous cornée et pyoderma gangrenosum[1]. Le SSW est une dermatose caractérisée par des papulonodules isolés ou en plaques, rarement purpuriques, touchant les membres, le tronc, le cou et parfois les muqueuses. D\\'autres localisations sont possibles : poumon, rate, foie et os. La fièvre et la leucocytose sont constantes. L\\'aspect histologique est évocateur : oedème dermique avec infiltrat neutrophilique. L\\'intérêt du SSW est son association à diverses affections:hémopathies malignes, tumeurs solides, maladie de Crohn, collagénoses et infections. Des cas de SSW induits par des médicaments ont été rapportés. Exceptionnellement, le SW a été décrit au cours d\\'agranulocytose compliquant une chimiothérapie. Les facteurs de croissance hématopoïétiques pourraient favoriser cette dermatose. Dans le myélome, les cas de SSW sont peu nombreux. Il s\\'agit le plus souvent de paraprotéine IgG. Le mécanisme serait lié à une synthèse accrue de facteur de croissance granulocytaire et une augmentation du chimiotactisme des neutrophiles. La corticothérapie est souvent efficace[1,2].[1] Bayer Garner IB,Smoller BR.The spectrum of cutaneous disease in L\\'examen clinique retrouve une splénomégalie isolée. La biologie associe lymphocytose atypique circulante et syndrome inflammatoire. Les prélèvements infectieux, l\\'immunophénotypage sur sang circulant, les sérologies et le bilan immunologique sont négatifs. Les LDH et la b2 microglobuline sont normaux. Le scanner retrouve une splénomégalie avec image tumorale calcifiée intra-splénique (82 X 76mm) et une hépatomégalie homogène à 18cm sans adénopathie. La BOM conclut à une moelle réactionnelle. La splénectomie permet d\\'exclure un lymphome de rate et de porter le diagnostic de PTIR. Les PTIR sont extrêmement rares avec moins de 100 cas dans la littérature [Ozkara S. IRM) est aspécifique montrant une lésion intra splénique qui peut être calcifiée. Elle ne permet pas de distinguer les PTIR des lymphomes primitifs ni des autres tumeurs bénignes de rate [Oz Puyan F. Eur J Haematol 2004; 72: 285-91]. La splénectomie permet le diagnostic histologique qui est difficile avec un aspect macroscopique de tumeur hématologique et microscopique compatible avec un lymphome de Hodgkin (LH). L\\'immunohistochimie élimine les diagnostics différentiels dont le LH. L\\'étiologie pourrait être autoimmune ou infectieuse (EBV). La splénectomie permet une évolution normalement favorable sans récidive (fréquentes dans les PTI du tractus respiratoire). Il n\\'y a pas de cas d\\'évolution maligne (décrite pour les PTI hépatiques). Néanmoins, un suivi prolongé semble nécessaire pour rechercher une rechute ou une évolution maligne. 968000/mm 3 .

Le scanner ne montrait pas d\\'anomalie pancréatique ou biliaire ; par contre, l\\'hémangiome ne mesurait plus que 8 cm et son aspect était compatible avec un remaniement sclérosant. Les anomalies cliniques et biologiques étaient rapportées à ce phénomène et une abstention thérapeutique était décidée. Cinq mois plus tard, l\\'angiome ne mesurait plus que 5 cm et 8 mois plus tard, les anomalies biologiques avaient disparu. Masse pancréatique chez une patiente de 69 ans C. Ungureanu, P.

Elle présente dans ses antécédents une tumeur cérébrale étiquetée méningiome, réséquée à l\\'âge de 32 ans, avec récidive cérébrale opérée en 1978 et hémiplégie séquellaire. Deux nodules pulmonaires sont découverts 11 ans plus tard, de type hémangiopéricytome en histologie. L\\'examen clinique montre une masse abdominale supra-ombilicale, mal limitée, mobile, peu sensible, ferme, et des aires ganglionnaires libres. La biologie standard et les marqueurs tumoraux sont normaux. Le scanner retrouve une masse hypervascularisée de 16/12 cm sur la tête du pancréas, et la biopsie révèle une tumeur mésenchymateuse exprimant le CD34. On conclut à une métastase pancréatique d\\'un hémangiopéricytome méningé. Il représente moins de 1% des tumeurs vasculaires, pouvant se développer dans tous les tissus de l\\'organisme, surtout au niveau des membres et du rétropéritoine [A. Benchekroun, E. Kasmaoui, M.

Commentaires. -Les pathologies associées au GAG sont variées [endocrinopathies, maladies systémiques, néoplasies -14 % de la série de la Mayo Clinic (Dabski et al. : JAAD ; 1989 ; 20 : 39 -47)]. Lymphomes hodgkiniens, non hodgkiniens et cancers du sein sont les plus représentés (Barsdale et al. JAAD 1994 ; 31 : 42 -8). Nous rapportons le second cas associé à un SMD et le premier cas associé à un cancer du col utérin. Le GAG peut précéder la pathologie maligne de plusieurs années. Il est difficile dans ce cas d\\'établir une corrélation. La signification pronostique de la dermatose n\\'est pas connue. La synthèse de certaines cytokines [TNF, TGF-, IL 2 , IL 6 ] par le clone tumoral rendrait compte de ce syndrome. En pratique, le diagnostic de GAG atypique [apparition et/ou extension rapides ; prurit] conduit à rechercher par l\\'examen clinique et des examens paracliniques orientés une pathologie maligne. M.

Les lésions glomérulaires minimes (LGM) sont plus rarement impliquées dans les SPR et concernent alors principalement des hémopathies malignes. Moins d\\'une vingtaine de cas de LGM associés à des tumeurs solides sont rapportés dans la littérature dont un cas de mésothéliome (Maesaka J.K et al. une forme localisée de mésothéliome de la vaginale à droite. Le traitement est chirurgical (scrotectomie droite). En septembre 2003, devant d\\'importants oedèmes des membres inférieurs et une ascite, un syndrome néphrotique (SN) sans insuffisance rénale est diagnostiqué : protéinurie à plus de 10g / 24 heures, hypoalbuminémie à 11 g/l. La biopsie rénale révèle des LGM, sans dépôt en immunofluorescence. Parallèlement, des adénopathies rétropéritonéales sont dépistées au scanner faisant craindre une récidive du mésothéliome dans le territoire de drainage de la tumeur initiale. Le SN est traité par corticothérapie à dose dégressive sur 5 mois permettant une disparition de la protéinurie. Simplement surveillées et stables, les adénopathies lomboaortiques vont augmenter de taille en mars 2004. Le SN récidive au même moment. La biopsie ganglionnaire confirme la rechute rétropéritonéale du mésothéliome (et écarte un lymphome, autre hypothèse possible compte tenu du type d\\'atteinte rénale). Le patient est traité par curage ganglionnaire lomboaortique et chimiothérapie (cisplatine + permetrexed) et par reprise de la corticothérapie (prednisone, 1mg/Kg) pour le SN. Toujours sous chimiothérapie et corticoïdes, le patient n\\'a pas rechuté (ni du cancer, ni du SN) en septembre 2004. Bien que l\\'histologie rénale soit inhabituelle, le parallélisme évolutif du SN et du cancer chez ce patient plaide fortement en faveur d\\'une origine paranéoplasique de cette néphropathie à LGM.\\nLes syndromes paranéoplasiques vasculaires sont rares (exception faite des thromboses veineuses) ; nous rapportons 3 nécroses digitales multiples comme symptôme inaugural d\\'un cancer. Dans la littérature environ 70 cas sont décrits.Cas 1 : homme de 51ans qui présente brutalement des nécroses distales du 2ème doigt droit et des 2ème et 3ème doigts gauches. Il a un état hémodynamique stable ; il n\\'a pas d\\'artériopathie des membres supérieurs ni de cardiopathie emboligène. Il ne prend aucun médicament vasoconstricteur ou bêtabloquant. Son bilan immunologique est sans anomalie (dont cryoglobulinémie). L\\'examen trouve un gros foie sensible métastatique (écho) et une image suspecte de cancer bronchique à la radio du thorax. Il reçoit des perfusions d\\'ilomédine mais décède en 3 semaines de ce cancer. Cas 2 : homme de 61ans traité pour un cancer bronchique par gemcitabine avec une stabilisation carcinologique qualifiée de satisfaisante. Trois mois après cette chimiothérapie il présente des nécroses quasi simultanées de plusieurs doigts et orteils. Il n\\'a pas en échographie de lésions athéromateuses significatives. Il reçoit des perfusions d\\'iloprost. Ces nécroses multiples « explosives » correspondent à une reprise évolutive tumorale avec métastases multiples et le patient décède en 2 mois Cas 3 : femme de 78 ans sans antécédent cardio-vasculaire, présente un acrosyndrome évolutif récent des orteils droits avec aggravation subaiguë en 15 jours et altération de l\\'état général. On découvre un cancer canalaire infiltrant du sein. Malgré des perfusions d\\'iloprost, des amputations d\\'orteils sont nécessaires. Une tumorectomie avec radiothérapie est faite. Stabilisation des problèmes ischémiques avec 6 mois de recul. Discussion. -Ces trois cas correspondent aux caractéristiques des nécroses digitales paranéoplasiques, à savoir : absence de choc hémodynamique, de causes médicamenteuses, de maladie de système, de lésions athéromateuses et d\\'embols de cholestérol mais apparition rapide de nécroses distales multiples, révélatrices d\\'un cancer ou d\\'une rechute et qui se stabilisent si le processus tumoral est accessible à un traitement.Syndrome de Sneddon : une cause d\\'atteinte cérébrovasculaire dans la trisomie-21 M.

Cette patiente a des antécédents de fibrillation auriculaire chronique, d\\'HTA et d\\'asthme allergique. Les 3 épisodes étaient identiques : d\\'allure septique, avec frissons, marbrures, fièvre à 40 o C s\\'atténuant en une dizaine de jours. Il n\\'y a pas d\\'altération de l\\'état général. La patiente se plaint également durant les accès de douleurs lombaires latéralisées, de douleur thoraciques (un épanchement pleural est noté une fois), de myalgies, de douleurs de l\\'épaule droite et d\\'une dyspnée d\\'effort. Aucun signe cutané n\\'est noté. Un syndrome inflammatoire est présent (CRP à 271 mg/l, polynucléose neutrophile à 11 800/mm 3 ), ainsi que des altérations du bilan hépatique sous forme d\\'une cytolyse et d\\'une cholestase anictérique discrète. Les recherches infectieuses (hémocultures, urocultures, sérologies, recherche de complication de lithiase vésiculaire, recherche de médiastinite ou d\\'ostéite sternale, d\\'endocardite) reviennent négatives, de même que celles d\\'une néoplasie profonde. Après 7 jours, la fièvre et le syndrome inflammatoire régressent spontanément, pour reprendre 22 jours après. La périodicité de la fièvre se précise et attire l\\'attention : la mère de la patiente est juive sépharade, mais il n\\'y a pas d\\'antécédent familiaux, et l\\'âge de la patiente rend le diagnostic de fièvre méditerranéenne familiale (FMF) peu probable. Le taux d\\'IgD est normal. Un diagnostic génétique de FMF et de Tumor necrosis factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) est demandé. La patiente est hétérozygote pour la mutation A744S du gène MFEV et hétérozygote pour la mutation R92Q du gène du récepteur du TNF _. L\\'hypothèse du TRAPS, à transmission dominante, est retenue, ce d\\'autant que la mutation R92Q est une mutation à pénétrance incomplète, ce qui peut expliquer le caractère pseudo-sporadique du tableau chez notre patiente et son expression très tardive [Dodé C et al.

Un homme vietnamien de 58 ans sans antécédent consultait pour une adénite sus-claviculaire droite. L\\'examen clinique était par ailleurs normal. Le bilan biologique était normal. Il n\\'existait pas de déficit immunitaire (immunoglobulines, CD4). Le bilan d\\'extension scannographique montrait des adénopathies sus-claviculaire et médiastinales. L\\'exérèse du ganglion cervical montrait un granulome épithélioïde avec Ziehl et culture négatifs. La recherche de mycobactéries par tubage gastrique et dans les urines était négative à l\\'examen direct mais positive à la culture d\\'un tubage au 14 e jour (mycobactérie atypique). La PCR identifiait un M. abscessus, sensible à la clarithromycine, l\\'amikacine, l\\'imipénème et au linezolide, mais résistant à la cefoxitine. Le traitement initial par Zeclar, Rifabutine, Myambutol, a été simplifié à deux mois par Zeclar en monothérapie d\\'après l\\'antibiogramme et devant la régression des adénopathies médiastinales. À huit mois, l\\'évolution montre une régression des ganglions.M. abscessus est responsable d\\'infections localisées chez l\\'immunocompétent et d\\'infections disséminées chez l\\'immunodéprimé. La revue de la littérature chez l\\'immunocompétent retrouve sept cas de lymphadénopathies [Sungkanuparph S et al.

Houman MH Service de médecine interne, hôpital la Rabta, Jebbari, 1007, Tunis, TunisieIntroduction. -La maladie de Kaposi (MK) est une prolifération angiogénique multifocale. Dans notre pays, la forme classique méditerranéenne est la plus fréquente représentant environ 94 % des cas.Elle se manifeste par des lésions cutanées caractéristiques associées à un lymphoèdème. Les atteintes viscérales symptomatiques sont peu fréquentes. Les organes les plus souvent touchés sont les ganglions, le tube digestif et l\\'os. L\\'atteinte du système nerveux central est exceptionnelle, celle du système nerveux périphérique n\\'a jamais été rapportée.Nous présentons l\\'observation d\\'un patient atteint d\\'un maladie pour MK classique associée à une multinévrite.Observation. -Il s\\'agit d\\'un homme âgé de 78 ans, d\\'origine tunisienne de race blanche sans antécédent pathologique notable présentant des plaques infiltrées érythémato-violines associé à un oedème au niveau des membres supérieurs et inférieurs ; il se plaignait de paresthésies et de dyésthésies au niveau des pieds. À l\\'examen, outre les lésions cutanées susdécrites il présentait des hypoesthésies du membre inférieur droit et une abolition des réflexes achilléens. Une biopsie cutanée a montré un sarcome de Kaposi. Un EMG a révélé une polyneuropathie sensitivo-motrice prédominante aux membres inférieurs de mécanisme axonal. La biopsie neuromusculaire a montré une atrophie neurogène et une neuropathie axonale discrète sans infiltrat inflammatoire. Le bilan étiologique de la multinévrite était négatif. La recherche d\\'autre localisation de MK était négative.Le diagnostic de MK classique associée à une multinévrite était retenu. Le patient a reçu 5 cures de bléomycine. L\\'évolution était favorable pour les lésions cutanées et la symptomatologie neurologique. Une année après, la même symptomatologie cutanée et neurologique a récidivé. Une deuxième série de cures de bléomycine était indiquée mais le patient était perdu de vue.Commentaire. -Il s\\'agit d\\'une MK classique associée à une multinévrite. S\\'agit-il d\\'une association fortuite ou d\\'une localisation de MK. En effet, d\\'une part, les signes cutanés de MK et la multinévrite ont été améliorés par la bléomycine et ont récidivé d\\'une façon concomitante après arrêt des cures, et d\\'autre part, cette association n\\'a jamais à notre connaissance était rapportée.Syndrome deLemierre : la maladie oubliée A.

La première difficulté diagnostique provenait de signes cliniques, biologiques et radiologiques aspécifiques. Une toux était présente chez 70 % des patients, une fièvre chez 45,6 %, un autre signe fonctionnel pulmonaire chez 17,8 %, et des signes digestifs chez 7 % des patients. Le bilan biologique était normal dans 48,7 % des cas, une lymphopénie était présente dans 36,5 % des cas, une thrombopénie dans unité de soins intensifs au 4 ejour. Devant une stabilisation clinico-biologique, le traitement antibiotique est interrompu au bout de 10 jours et la patiente transférée en pneumologie. Une pneumopathie à la cordarone est suspectée et un traitement par corticoïdes est débuté. Cinq jours plus tard après une amélioration clinique et une diminution de la CRP à 16 mg/l, l\\'état de la patiente s\\'aggrave à nouveau avec apparition d\\'un SDRA nécessitant une ventilation artificielle. Une infection nosocomiale pulmonaire est objectivée et malgré l\\'utilisation d\\'un traitement antibiotique adapté, la patiente décède trois semaines après son admission en réanimation dans un tableau de défaillance multiviscérale. 15 jours après sont décès, les sérologies reviennent positives en faveur d\\'une fièvre Q aiguë.Discussion. -Les formes aiguës de fièvre Q ont classiquement un bon pronostic. Les formes sévères nécessitant une hospitalisation sont rares (<5 % des cas). Cette observation montre qu\\'en cas d\\'infection pulmonaire à germes intracellulaires prouvée ou suspectée, l\\'amélioration clinique peut être retardée et le traitement antibiotique doit être maintenu au minimum trois semaines.Intérêt de la corticothérapie précoce en cas de méningite à Pneumocoque E.

Le patient bénéficie d\\'une antibiothérapie associant céfotaxime et vancomycine sans corticothérapie permettant une apyrexie rapide et l\\'amélioration du syndrome inflammatoire biologique. A J10, apparaît une anisocorie et un coma : il est intubé-ventilé et transféré en réanimation. L\\'IRM cérébrale montre des lésions de vascularite cérébrale diffuse et malgré l\\'administration de fortes doses de méthylprednisolone, il décède en 48 heures. Depuis près de 20 ans il est démontré que les conséquences neurologiques des méningites bactériennes ne résultent pas d\\'un effet cytopathogène direct des bactéries mais qu\\'elles sont liées à la réponse inflammatoire locale, suggérant l\\'intérêt des corticoïdes. Néanmoins, les études cliniques étaient jusqu\\'alors contradictoires et la corticothérapie n\\'était validée qu\\'en cas de méningite infantile à H. influen-zae [McIntyre et al. JAMA 1997 ; 278 :25-31], elle semblait bénéfique en cas de méningite à pneumocoques [Girgis et al. Pediatr Infect Dis 1989 ; 8 : 848-51] mais son utilisation systématique restait controversée jusqu\\'à fin 2002. En effet, une récente étude contrôlée prospective portant sur 301 patients affectés de méningite (dont 108 à pneumocoque) montre que la dexaméthasone (40 mg/j pendant 4 jours) réduit significativement la mortalité (7 vs 15 %) notamment dans le sous-groupe pneumocoque (14 vs 34 %) sans complication notable [De Gans, N Engl J Med 2002 ; 347 : 54-62]. Désormais, la corticothérapie précoce (avant de débuter l\\'antibiothérapie) s\\'impose en cas de méningite bactérienne de l\\'adulte : notre observation en est une triste illustration.

Les critères diagnostiques retenus sont un antigène urinaire positif et/ou une culture positive et/ou un titre d\\'anticorps supérieur à 1/256, et/ou une séroconversion et/ou une PCR positive. Vingt patients sont retenus.Le sex ratio H/F est de 4, l\\'âge moyen de 61 ans avec des extrêmes de 22 à 94 ans. Quinze patients sont âgés de plus de 50 ans. Un facteur de risque est retrouvé chez 18 patients Parmi eux, dans 8 cas, il existe un cancer, une hémopathie ou une immunodépression autre que la corticothérapie retrouvée chez trois patients. Seize des patients ont au moins deux facteurs de risque. Huit patients sont hospitalisés en unité de soins intensifs dont 4 sont intubés et ventilés. Des signes digestifs sont présents cinq fois et des anomalies neurologiques sont retrouvées 7 fois. Les paramètres biologiques n\\'ont pas de caractéristiques particulières. Le temps moyen du diagnostic biologique est de 12,5 jours après l\\'admission. L\\'examen le plus rentable est la culture positive chez neuf patients, suivi de l\\'antigène urinaire chez sept patients puis des sérologies. Les sérogroupes sont Legionella pneumophila de type 1 dans dix cas puis L. pneumophila type 6 dans quatre cas. L\\'évolution est marquée par le décès de 6 patients. Parmi eux, quatre viennent d\\'unité de soins intensifs dont sont trois intubés et ventilés. L\\'analyse du traitement est difficile. Chez sept patients, le traitement est inadapté et modifié à la réception des résultats. Parmi les six patients décédés quatre avaient reçu une antibiothérapie initiale par macrolide. Parmi les patients de réanimation, trois des patients survivants avaient reçu initialement une antibiothérapie par fluoroquinolones. Chez 6 patients au moins, le caractère nosocomial est certain.

Poulingue, G. Denis, V. Perraudin, D. Noël Service de médecine interne, CHG les Feugrais, avenue du Docteur Villlers, 76410 Saint Aubin les Elbeuf, France La cryptococcose pulmonaire et méningée est connue chez les patients séropositifs pour le VIH ayant moins de 100 CD4/mm 3 et chez les patients neutropéniques. Elle est exceptionnelle dans les autres immunosuppressions (Nadrous H.F et al. CHEST 2003;124:2143-2147). Nous rapportons un cas de cryptococcose pulmonaire chez un patient diabétique insulinodépendant (DID). Il s\\'agit d\\'un patient de 48 ans, DID depuis 10 ans, hospitalisé pour acidocétose dans un contexte de toux fébrile et d\\'altération de l\\'état général. Le patient est alcoolo-tabagique avec un mauvais état buccodentaire et travaille en contact avec de la poussière de SIPO (bois exotique). Il présente une toux productive avec crachats hemoptoïques, des râles bronchiques sans foyer, il est cachectique, il existe une hépato-splénomégalie. Biologiquement il présente une acidocétose diabétique, une thrombopénie et un syndrome inflammatoire. La radiographie thoracique montre de multiples nodules pulmo-naires périphériques confirmés par la tomodensitométrie. La bronchoscopie avec prélévements multiples sont normaux. L\\'épreuve thérapeutique par une antibiothérapie classique est inactive. Le patient s\\'aggrave, une thoracoscopie avec biopsies pulmonaires va mettre en évidence sur le plan anatomopathologique une cryptococcose pulmonaire. Un complément de bilan montre que le patient est séronégatif pour le VIH, son taux de CD4 est à 350/mm3 , sa ponction lombaire avec encre de chine est normale. Le patient est traité sept j par une bithérapie antifungique associant Amphotéricine B ® et Ancotil ® puis pendant 3 mois par Triflucan® 200 mg/ jour (Nunez.M et al. CHEST 2000;118:527-534). Le patient a totalement gueri sans rechute. Il est décrit des cas de cryptococcose pulmonaire chez des patients fortement immunodéprimés en contact avec des fientes de pigeons ou exposés aux poussières de bois éxotique. Ce cas clinique illustre bien le fait que nos patients diabétiques polypathologiques sont profondément immunodéprimés car pouvant développer une infection opportuniste comme chez des patients VIH + ayant moins de 100 CD4/mm 3 . Il faut donc savoir penser à une infection opportuniste chez nos malades diabétiques présentant une altération de l\\'état général et/ou un syndrome infectieux persistant inexpliqué.

Des formes disséminées peuvent survenir tardivement après l\\'infestation intestinale. Un patient de 79 ans est hospitalisé pour une hyperéosinophilie (HE) dans un contexte d\\'insuffisance cardiaque. Le patient né en Asie du Sud-Est y a vécu 18 ans,et son traitement actuel est limité à un diurétique et un antivitamine K pour une fibrillation auriculaire. L\\'examen clinique montre un patient en anasarque par insuffisance cardiaque globale. Il existe une insuffisance rénale (créatinine à 200 µmol/l), une HE fluctuante entre 2,5 et 5 G/l, un taux d\\'IgE totales à 10 N. L\\'examen parasitologique des selles met en évidence des larves d\\'anguillules. La sérologie HTLV1 est négative. L\\'échocardiographie montre des cavités droites dilatées, une FEVG conservée à 70 %, des pressions de remplissage élevées et une HTAP à 40 mmHg. L\\'éradication du parasite dans les selles et la disparition de l\\'HE sont obtenues par un traitement associant Albendazole et Ivermectine en continu pendant 14 jours. L\\'évolution dans le service est catastrophique avec une décompensation cardiaque réfractaire, une insuffisance respiratoire avec bronchoconstriction sévère et une insuffisance rénale oligoanurique, conduisant au décès du patient. L\\'anguillulose se distingue des autres helminthiases par un cycle interne d\\'autoinfestation expliquant la possible survenue tardive d\\'une « anguillulose maligne » à l\\'occasion d\\'une corticothérapie ou d\\'une immunodépression. Les manifestations sont alors multiples : pulmonaires (asthme sévère, oedème lésionnel), cardiaques (insuffisance ventriculaire droite liée à une HTAP, défaillance ventriculaire gauche avec trouble du rythme), septicémique par translocation bactérienne à partir des lésions muqueuses digestives [Daoudal P et al Presse Med 2002 ; 31 :1216-7].Chez notre patient, nous retenons l\\'hypothèse d\\'une myocardiopathie restrictive chronique par fibrose endomyocardique (documentée sur les données échocardiographiques et du cathétérisme droit) d\\'origine hyperéosinophilique, dont l\\'évolution fatale a été précipitée par une résurgence « maligne » de l\\'anguillulose, responsable de la défaillance multiviscérale de pronostic très péjoratif (80 % de décès).Un syndrome de malabsorption révélant une leishmaniose duodénaleA.

Three genomic vivo-MOs target sequences (5' to 3') are indicated as(1)-(3)within the proposed secondary structures of the IRES region and the RdRP gene of EV-71 RNA. The sequences of these three targeted regions were aligned across all EV-71 genotypes, CV-A16 and PV.\\nFig. 2. Inhibitory effect of vivo-MOs in RD cells. Various concentrations of vivo-MOs were applied to RD cells one hour post infection and (A) viral induced CPE (20 Â objective) were observed 24 hpi. The total infectious particles or total viral proteins were harvested 24 hpi and evaluated by (B) plaque assay, (C) quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR, and (D) western blot analysis, respectively. EV-71 viral capsid protein was detected by mouse anti-EV-71 monoclonal antibody (Millipore) and cellular b-actin was detected using mouse anti-b-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The data presented were obtained from at least two independent biological replicates.\\nTime and specificity of vivo-MOs antiviral properties. (A) Vivo-MOs at a final concentration of 5 lM were applied to RD cells at various time points relative to EV-71 inoculation. In brief, vivo-MOs were applied for 4 h before, or 1, 2, 4, or 6 h after EV-71 infection at a MOI of 0.1. (B) RD cells were pre-treated with each of the vivo-MOs at a final concentration of 5 lM for 4 h at 37°C before infection with other enteroviruses (EV-71 strain BrCr, UH1/97, PV and CV-A16) and CHIKV at a MOI of 0.1. The inhibitoryeffects of each of the vivo-MOs were evaluated by plaque assay 24 hpi and the percentages of inhibition are shown. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control. The data presented were obtained from at least two independent biological replicates.\\nTranslation inhibition assay. (A) In vitro translation was performed with 1 lg of RNA using 1-step human coupled IVT kit (Pierce Biotechnology) either in the presence of vivo-MOs at a final concentration of 10 lM. Aliquots of 20 ll of translated product was subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. EV-71 viral protein was detected by anti-EV-71 monoclonal antibody through chemiluminescence. (B) EV-71-EGFP inhibition assay. RD cells were first infected with EV-71-EGFP for one hour, followed by addition of maintenance medium containing 2.5 lM of vivo-MOs. The EGFP expression was evaluated 6 hpi using a fluorescence microscope. Nuclei were stained with DAPI.\\nDNA sequence analysis of vivo-MO-1. (A) EV-71 was serially passaged in the presence of vivo-MO-1 from 1 lM to 5 lM. EV-71 populations that showed resistance to vivo-MO-1 were plaque purified, and subjected to DNA sequencing.

Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes should receive pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and, because of an increased risk for progression to active tuberculosis, should receive treatment for latent tuberculosis infection if they have a tuberculin skin test greater than 10 mm or a positive interferongamma release assay. ■ Thyroid enlargement may cause upper airway compression. Patients with hyperthyroidism may have dyspnea worsened by decreases in vital capacity and respiratory muscle strength. More commonly, patients with hypothyroidism suffer from dyspnea, alveolar hypoventilation, pleural effusion, and, sometimes, respiratory failure. ■ Secondary hyperparathyroidism from end-stage renal disease often causes diffuse metastatic pulmonary calcification, which frequently is asymptomatic. ■ Endogenous Cushing syndrome predisposes to a variety of opportunistic infections, whereas acromegaly from excess growth hormone is associated with a high prevalence of sleep apnea, and may lead to upper airway structural disorders. reference list available at ExpertConsult.Black  MH, Anderson A, Bell RA, et al: Pediatrics.

Overall influenza detection was highest 48% (133/276) among children aged 5-14 years (OR = 2.51, CI 1.90-3.30, p<0.001) (Table 1). Children under 1 year showed the lowest level of influenza virus positivity (17%, 11/63; OR = 0.36, CI 0.19-0.69, p = 0.001) and cases under 5 years of age showed lower levels of influenza infection compared to older patients (25.7%, OR = 0.64, CI 0.49-0.83, p = 0.001). Stratification of positive cases based on dominant influenza subtypes for particular seasons revealed that children aged 5-14 years were the group most affected by influenza B viruses (2014-2015 season-40%, OR = 2.95, CI 1.75-4.96, p<0.001; 2016-2017 season-27%, OR = 4.10, CI 2.17-7.73, p<0.001) followed by the age group 15-29 years (2016-2017 season, 24%, OR = 2.45, CI 1.20-5.03, p = 0.012). A/H3N2 viruses were mostly seen in children aged 5-14 years (2016-2017 season, 35%, OR = 2.22, CI 1.31-3.77, p = 0.004) while the highest A/H1N1pdm09 virus detection rate was among the 30-64 year-olds (2015-2016 season, 32%, OR = 1.76, CI 1.13-2.75, p = 0.012).\\nReferral of ILI cases to outpatient clinic vs laboratory-confirmed influenza detections by week, 2014-2017, Georgia.

Sequencing of HA and NA genes of 19 A/H1N1pdm09 viruses was performed (Fig 4, S2 Fig). All four 2014-2015 season viruses belonged to the 6B genetic group characterized by encoding the amino acid substitutions P83S, D97N, K163Q, S185T, S203T, A256T, K283E and I321V in HA1 and E47K, S124N and E172K in HA2 compared to A/California/7/2009 and clustered with the reference virus A/South Africa/3626/2013. The NA of these four viruses differed from A/California/7/2009 by thirteen amino acid substitutions: I34V, L40I, N44S (gain of a glycosylation site), I117M, N200S, V241I, N248D, I321V, Y351F, I365T, N369K, N386K (loss of a glycosylation site) and K432E. HA genes of nine viruses circulating early in the 2015-2016 season belonged to group 6B and encoded two additional amino acid substitutions K311T in HA1 and L37Q in HA2. The NA sequences of these viruses also fell in genetic group 6B and carried additional substitutions: T289I and I396M. The HA genes of six viruses from later in the 2015-2016 season fell into genetic subgroup 6B.1 characterized by encoding the substitutions S84N, S162N (introducing a new potential glycosylation site) and I216T in HA1 and clustered with reference virus A/Slovenia/2903/2015. NA genes of the same viruses also belonged to subgroup 6B.1, encoding the substitutions V13I, K264I, N270K and I314M in the NA glycoprotein. A/H3N2. A/H3N2 viruses have undergone extensive evolution in recent years and a number of genetic clades/groups have been designated, indicated below in parentheses after virus names. Of 28 A/H3N2 viruses from the three seasons 22 (79%) were recovered by the WHO CCs. In the 2014-2015 season all four A/H3N2 viruses were cultured from clinical samples but only one virus, A/Georgia/532/2015, had HA activity. It was poorly recognized by antisera raised against the 2014-2015 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012 (3C.1), and antisera raised against both cell culture-propagated and egg-propagated cultivars of the 2015-2016 season A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (3C.3a) vaccine virus. However, A/Georgia/ 532/2015 was recognized well by antisera raised against cell culture-propagated A/Victoria/ 361/2011(3C.1) and both cell culture-propagated and egg-propagated cultivars of A/Stockholm/6/2014 (3C.3a). Five of ten viruses from the 2015-2016 season were recovered, based on detection of sialidase activity, but only three had HA activity. Antiserum raised against the 2015-2016 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (3C.3a), recognized all three\\nHA gene phylogeny of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 viruses detected in Georgia during 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons. Vaccine viruses are indicated in red, viruses from Georgia for 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons are shown in blue and pink viruses poorly, but they were recognized by antiserum raised against the 2016-2017 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (3C.2a), at titers only 4-fold lower than the homologous titer of the antiserum. Twelve viruses were isolated from 14 samples of the 2016-2017 season, but 11 were unable to agglutinate RBCs and only one virus (A/Georgia/1819/2016) was analyzed by HI assay. It was recognized by an antiserum raised against the recommended 2017-2018 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, at a titer within 4-fold of the homologous titer of the antiserum. In total, 27 A/H3N2 viruses were sequenced (Fig 5, S3 Fig). Analysis of HA and NA genes of four viruses from the 2014-2015 season revealed that one virus belonged to genetic subgroup 3C.3b, encoding HA amino acid substitutions compared to the 3C.3 group: E62K, K83R, N122D (losing a glycosylation site), L157S, R261Q in HA1 and V18K in HA2, with this virus (A/Georgia/342/2015) carrying HA1 Q197H, as did some other viruses of the 3C.3b genetic subgroup. The NA gene of A/Georgia/342/2015 carried mutations encoding amino acid substitutions I26T, M51V, V143G, E221D, V263I and T434N. The HA gene of the other three viruses clustered in subgroup 3C.2a, characterized by amino acid substitutions L3I, N144S (resulting in the loss of a potential glycosylation motif), F159Y, K160T (resulting in the gain of a potential glycosylation site), N225D and Q311H in HA1. A/Georgia/532/2015 (3C.2a) carried HA1 amino acid substitutions R142K and Q197R and showed polymorphism at the 158-160 glycosylation motif which, when glycosylated in typical 3C.2a viruses, prevents the agglutination of RBCs. The NA genes of the 3C.2a viruses clustered together and encoded amino acid substitutions T267K and I380V in the NA glycoprotein. HA gene sequence analysis of 2015-2016 season viruses showed that four of the five fell in subclade 3C.2a1 and one in clade 3C.3a, the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 clade. The HA gene of the 3C.3a virus encoded HA1 amino acid substitution Y94H, commonly seen in 3C.3a viruses collected during the 2015-2016 season. The NA gene of this virus clustered with other 3C.3a subclade viruses. 3C.2a1 viruses from Georgia had, in addition to the clade defining substitutions (N171K in HA1 and I77V and G155E in HA2), the HA1 amino acid substitution S46Y. The NA genes of these four viruses clustered with other 3C.2a1 subclade viruses and differed from the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 vaccine virus by encoding the substitutions S245N (resulting in the gain of a new glycosylation motif), S247T (a substitution that maintained a glycosylation motif at residues 245-247), T267K, D339N, I380V, T392I and P468H. All 18 sequenced viruses of the 2016-2017 season from Georgia belonged to subclade 3C.2a1. Two viruses showed mixed sequences encoding the glycosylation motif at residues 158-160 in HA1 following culture; one of them, A/Georgia/1819/2016, was able to agglutinate RBCs. The HA genes of viruses from Georgia clustered in two subgroups: the first encoding an HA1 R142G substitution (12 viruses) and the second with HA1 amino acid changes K92R, N121K and H311Q (6 viruses). The NA genes of viruses from Georgia had the same clustering pattern as the HA genes and the NAs of all differed from that of the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine virus by 7 amino acid substitutions: S245N (resulting in the gain of a new glycosylation site), S247T (maintaining the glycosylation motif), I231V, T267K, I380V, T392I and P468H. The NAs of 12 viruses also carried the amino acid substitutions L140I, V143M, S315R and D339N. Influenza B. respectively.

Reference B/Yamagata lineage Eleven (92%) of twelve viruses of the 2014-2015 season were successfully recovered. In HI analyses all but two viruses showed reduced recognition by antiserum raised against the eggpropagated B/Massachusetts/02/2012 vaccine virus (clade 2) used in the 2014-2015 season; however, all test viruses were recognized very well by antisera raised against egg-propagated viruses from clade 3 (including B/Phuket/3073/2013, the recommended influenza B component for 2015-2016 trivalent vaccines). Sequence analysis of eight viruses showed that HA and NA genes belonged to clade 3, the B/Wisconsin/1/2010 -B/Phuket/3073/2013 clade (S4 and S5 Figs). All viruses differed from the 2014-2015 season vaccine virus, B/Massachusetts/2/2012, by 11 HA1 amino acid substitutions (K48R, A108P, N116K, S150I, N165Y, L172Q, A181T, N202S, G229D, K298E and E312K) and by 13 NA amino acid substitutions (I45V, H65R, A68T, L73P, I106T, T125K, K186R, V248I, R295S, E320K, K343E, D463N and A465T). The HA and NA genes of 7 viruses formed a tight cluster with the NAs being defined by Q42R amino acid substitution (S5 Fig). B/Victoria lineage Seven (54%) of 13 viruses from the 2015-2016 season were recovered and analyzed by HI. Two viruses reacted well with post-infection ferret antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/ Brisbane/60/2008, the recommended influenza B component in northern hemisphere quadrivalent vaccines. The other five were recognized poorly by the same antiserum, but were recognized well by antisera raised against two cell culture-propagated viruses (B/Ireland/3154/2016 and B/Nordrhein-Westfalen/1/2016) genetically closely related to, and serving as surrogates for, cell-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008. Eleven (92%) of 12 viruses from the 2016-2017 season were recovered. All but two were poorly recognized by antiserum raised against the vaccine virus egg-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008 but recognized well by antisera raised against cell culture-propagated reference viruses (B/Hong Kong/514/2009, B/Ireland/3154/2016 and B/Nordrhein-Westfalen/1/ 2016) at titers generally similar to the respective homologous titers of the antisera, all of which were low. HA and NA genes of the 18 viruses fell into clade 1A, the B/Brisbane/60/2008 vaccine virus clade, but carried amino acid substitutions compared to B/Brisbane/60/2008: I117V and N129D in HA1 and I120V, K220N, S295R, N340D, E358K and D384G in the NA. Nine of 11 viruses from the 2016-2017 season carried additional substitutions of I45M, T72A, P336S in the NA (S6 and S7 Figs).\\nA/Texas/ 50/2012-like (3C.1) for 2014-2015, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like (3C.3a) for 2015-2016 and A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like (3C.2a) for 2016-2017 seasons respectively (http://www.\\n, viruses isolated in Georgia and worldwide over the 2014-2017 seasons clearly differed antigenically from A/Texas/50/2012, while viruses in 3C.3a, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1 genetic groups appeared more closely related when assessed using post-infection ferret antisera raised against multiple representatives of each group. B/Yamagata viruses from Georgia in the 2014-2015 season were antigenically similar to B/ Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses (clade 3), as approximately 70% of the influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses circulating in the European region [17], and differed from the B/Massachusetts/02/2012 vaccine virus (clade 2). HA genes of all clade 3 viruses encoded single amino acid substitutions in each antigenic site: the 120-loop, the 150-loop, the 160-loop and the 190-helix compared to viruses falling in clade 2. Amino acid substitutions in the 120-loop are known to alter virus antigenicity [36], so this might explain poor recognition of clade 3 viruses by antiserum raised against the B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (clade 2) egg-propagated vaccine virus. Influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses circulating in Georgia during 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons belonged to clade 1A, the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade. Trivalent influenza vaccines for 2015-2016 contained a virus of the B/Yamagata lineage (a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus) while the vast majority of influenza B viruses detected in the European region were B/Victoria lineage [15]. Despite such lineage mismatch, immune responses to the vaccine can provide some cross-protection against infection by viruses of the other influenza B lineage\\nFig. Map of Georgia.

Thirteen(48%) of 27 deaths occurred during the 2015-2016 season when the dominant virus was A/ H1N1pdm09 and, despite the dominance of influenza B viruses in 2014-2015, there were still seven deaths associated with A/H1N1pdm09 that season. Patients infected with A/ H1N1pdm09 had a higher risk of fatal outcome compared to A/H3N2 and influenza B infection (OR 4.31, CI 1.75-10.35, p = 0.001). The age of patients who died ranged from 1 to 84 years (median 55 years, IQR 52-64), with 18 (67%) of 27 fatal cases being in the 30-64 years age group, yielding a high odds of fatal outcome (OR 10.18, CI 4.43-23.36 <0.001).A/ H1N1pdm09 influenza confirmed cases aged 30-64 years had statistically significant higher risk for a fatal outcome compared to those in other age groups (OR 11.41, CI 3.94-33.04, p<0.001,).

Peripheral signals such as cytokines (CK) reach the hypothalamus, specifically the arcuate nucleus (ARC), where they interact with two neuronal populations, which project to second-order neuronal signalling pathways. Neuropeptide Y/Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons stimulate food intake. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)/cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) neurons inhibit food intake.

       "       'makes a difference between metritis (putrid vaginal discharge with no enlargement of the uterine lumen), open pyometra (putrid vaginal discharge with enlargement of the uterine lumen) and closed pyometra (enlargement of the uterine lumen without vaginal discharge). Two years later, Verstegen et al. in 2008 (29) only used the term \"pyometra\". A similar confusion may exist when using the term \"endometritis\", as it may designate different pathological conditions, which may be acute or chronic, and may be associated or not with CEH (35). For some authors (30), it defines a sub-clinical inflammation of the endometrium that does not extend beyond the stratum spongiosum, corresponding histologically to a localized breakthrough into the endometrial epithelium, infiltration of inflammatory cells, vascular congestion, stromal oedema and accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the upper layers of the endometrium. This \"endometritis\" corresponds more or less to the second stage described by Dow in 1959 (31) from pathological and acute inflammation and even zones of haemorrhage), stage 4 (CEH with chronic endometritis, lympho-plasmocytic infiltration of the endometrium and modifications of the myometrium). This heterogeneity of the nomenclature complicates our understanding of the role of sub-clinical endometritis as creating infertility in the bitch. For example, in a recent study (32) using in vitro explants of endometrium taken from bitches suffering from CEH, the authors postulated that these bitches were accurate models of a mating-induced endometritis because the bitches with endometrial hyperplasia had a mild histological inflammatory reaction similar to that noted by De Bosschere et al. in 2001 (33). However, in 2013 in the study of Mir et al. (34) who analyzed the histological features of surgical biopsies taken on infertile bitches or bitches who suffered from pregnancy arrest, there were several cases of lympho-plasmocytic endometritis or neutrophilic endometritis that were not associated with endometrial hyperplasia.\\npublished clinical reports. In addition, different definitions of diseases and different diagnostic procedures are applied. According to these authors, systematic research results on the clinical and reproductive features of ovarian diseases are not available. Many publications are based on case reports that, in general, provide little evidence. Also, studies with small sample sizes may provide biased impressions about the nature or presentation of a disease, if extreme or rare cases are frequently reported. Regarding cystic ovarian diseases, mostly cases with follicular cysts have been published\\nFor example, the GnRH agonist deslorelin has been commercialized in Europe for about 10 years, and has been used in experimental protocols in dogs and in cats, in-label and off-label. If we want to have data on the reversibility after implanting male cats with the most common 4.7 mg SC implant, there is only one published study based on only 10 male cats housed in experimental conditions (54), although there are some published studies based on the 9.4 mg SC implant. Veterinarians should not consider this study as giving a definitive scientific conclusion. Recent unpublished work in our group tend to show that there are considerable variations depending on the breed and on the environment (55). Therefore, in the faith of any recent study, it is recommended to remain prudent in drawing any conclusion until there is enough data collected. 8.

Following the example of the group of Beauvais et al. (17,18) it would be very valuable to make critical reviews of founding articles that have been published a long time ago. Due to the growing interest in SAR, a high quality of published data should be mandatory, which also implies finding accurate and meticulous reviewers. The growing interest for getting knowledge and learning techniques in the field of SAR will probably reduce the gap between unverified beliefs and scientific facts.

       "       \"88 sexually transmitted diseases in the world and is mainly caused by HSV-2. HSV-2 89 affects approximately 16% of the world's population in the age range of 15-49 years 90 Looker et al., 2008), and it has been shown to increase the risk of human 91 immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sexual acquisition (Freeman et al., 2006). 92 Currently, antiviral drugs are mainly based on three nucleoside analogs: acyclovir, 93 famciclovir and valacyclovir. These drugs significantly inhibit virus replication and 94 improve symptoms in patients, but cannot cure the infection or prevent the spread of 95 HSV-2, and the problem of drug resistance is becoming increasingly pronounced. 96 Patients with impaired immune function may not benefit from the treatment. Besides, 97 the HSV-2 vaccine efficacy trials with individuals with recurrent HSV-2 infection 98 were mostly unsuccessful (Hofstetter et al., 2014). Therefore, the development of new 99 antiviral drugs continues to be explored by scientists and technicians.100 As a cellular defense mechanism, autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic 101 pathway, has received increasing attention in the defense of microbes. Autophagy is a 102 cell homeostasis process that is maintained by fusion of autophagosomes, consisting 103 of intracellular protein aggregates and damaged organelles coated with a double layer 104 of isolated membrane, with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Autophagy reportedly 105 removes damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, protects cells from nutrient 106 deprivation and microbial infections, and prevents metabolic, heart and 107 neurodegenerative diseases (He et al., 2017). Increasing evidence suggests that host 108 cells attempt to control herpesvirus infection by activating autophagy (Cavignac and itching, and frequent urination to verify and confirm the protective effects of JZ-1 on 152 cervicitis caused by U. urealyticum (Wei et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2007). Our previous 153 research showed that JieZe-2(composed of JZ-1 and the spermicide nonoxynol-9 154 (N-9) can prevent C. albicans and T. vaginalis infection in vivo and in vitro (Chen et 155 al., 2009a; Chen et al., 2009b; Chen et al., 2009c). Taken together, these results 156 suggest that JZ-1 is a valid prescription for damp-heat syndrome, with an action 157 similar to that of Yihuang Tang. Furthermore, some studies have shown that 158 traditional Chinese medicines that can clear heat or remove dampness have an 159 excellent effect on HSV-2 infection (Cheng et al., 2008a; Cheng et al., 2008b; Chin et 160 al., 2010; Sheng, 2010). Therefore, we investigated the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 161 infection in vitro, and fond it to be a potent anti-HSV-2 herbal medicine. Our previous 162 experiments showed that JZ-1 decoction could protect human vaginal epithelial cells 163 against HSV-2. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 is superior to that of berberine or 164 penciclovir, and the effect is mainly achieved by augmenting the host cell defenses 165 ability and blocking the adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 (Duan et al., 2019). In a 166 model of HSV-2-infected VK2/E6E7 cells, the expression of the HSV-2 envelope 167 protein gD increased gradually over time, and JZ-1 reduced this gD expression but 168 had no effect on HVEM in the human vaginal epithelial cells infected by HSV-2 (Ai 169 and Chen, 2017; Qiao and Chen, 2016). Moreover, the mechanism involved in the 170 anti-HSV-2 action of JZ-1 may be related to the regulation of the Toll-like receptor 171 signaling pathway and likely is promoted by the secretion of interferon and other 172 downregulating inflammatory factors (Huang and Chen, 2018). However, the related 173 antiviral mechanism of JZ-1 is not fully understood and needs further explanation. 174 Recent studies have shown that HSV-2 blocks autophagic flux but host cells increase 175 autophagy levels to inhibit viral infection in the later stages of the viral replication 176 cycle (Kristen et al., 2015; Petrovski et al., 2014). Therefore, this study explored the 177 underlying mechanisms of JZ-1 in treating HSV-2 infection by inducing autophagy. of 10 traditional Chinese medicines, and the details of the herbal 185 ingredients are shown in\\nSelleck, and LY294002 was purchased from MCE (MedChemExpress, 215 Shanghai, China).

The antibody for SQSTM1/p62 was obtained from Proteintech, 3. Cell culture and HSV-2 infection 223 The human immortalized vaginal epithelial cell line (VK2/E6E7) was purchased 224 from the American Type Culture Collection, and the Vero cell line was obtained from 225 the Chinese Type Culture Collection. The VK2/E6E7 cells were cultured in Cn-TPR 226 medium (CELLnTEC, Switzerland), and the Vero cells were cultured in Dulbecco's 227 modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were 228 grown at 37℃ in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. 229 HSV-2 strain 333 was propagated on a monolayer of Vero cells and stored at 230 -80℃ after harvest. We infected VK2/E6E7 cells with HSV-2 for different exposure 231 times (6, 12, 18, 24,48 h), and 24 h post-infection was selected as the time point for 232 the follow-up experiments based on the relevant results.\\n°C.

After blocking with 5% BSA powder with ultrapure 264 water for 1 h, the membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies 265 (anti-LC3B, anti-Atg5, anti-SQSTM1/p62, anti-p-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-PI3K,\\nVK2/E6E7 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% 274 paraformaldehyde and incubated with the primary antibody (anti-LC3B) overnight at 275 4℃ and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h at room 276 temperature. The nuclei were stained with DAPI before the end of the procedure to 277 visualize the nuclei.\\n9. Observations by transmission electron microscopy 280 The culture supernatant was discarded after treatment, and the unrinsed cells 281 were collected and fixed overnight in cold glutaraldehyde fixative (2.5% in 0.1 mol / 282 L cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) and post-fixed in osmium tetroxide. After dehydration 283 with a series of graded ethanol concentrations, the samples were rinsed with 284 propylene oxide and impregnated with epoxy resins.

The results of HPLC 297 fingerprint have been shown in a previous article (Duan et al., 2019), a total of six 298 JZ-1 components were determined, namely berberine, paeoniflorin, neoastilbin,\\n306 corresponding time point, with the greatest increase observed 24 h after infection (Fig. 307 1A). Therefore, 24 h post infection was selected as the time point for the follow3. Cytotoxicity and anti-HSV-2 activity of JZ-1 311As shown inFig. 1Band C, JZ-1 was cytotoxic at concentrations > 5 mg/mL, and 312 at 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL JZ-1, the cells exerted anti-HSV-2 activity.313Considering these results, we chose 5 mg/mL as the final concentration of JZ-1 to use 314 in this study.\\n320phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form, LC3B-II, which specifically binds to 321 autophagosome membranes. Changes in LC3B provide a handy marker of autophagy 322 that can be monitored by immunofluorescence and western blotting. In addition, as 323 autophagic flux increases, SQSTM1/p62, another autophagy marker, is recruited to 324 autophagosomes(Klionsky et al., 2016). During the formation of the double-layer 325 autophagy isolation membrane, the ubiquitin-like conjugate ATG12-ATG5 localizes to 326 the autophagosome precursors, and plays an essential role, with LC3, in their 327 development into autophagosomes(Mizushima et al., 2001). Besides, the 328 SQSTM1/p62 protein is the link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates, and both 329 LC3 and SQSTM1/p62 serve as indexes of autophagic flux(Bjorkoy et al., 2005). To 330 examine the effects of HSV-2 infection on autophagy, we examined the protein 331 expression levels of LC3B, SQSTM1/p62 and Atg5. The results from the 332 immunofluorescence analysis showed that LC3B was increased in the HSV-2-infected 333 cells(Fig. 2B), a result similar to that from the western blot analysis(Fig. 1A),334    suggesting an accumulation of autophagic elements in the infected cells. Increased335 LC3B-II levels may be the result of autophagy activation or reduced autophagic 336 turnover due to defects in the late stages of autophagic degradation. Was the increased 337 LC3B-II level induced by HSV-2 infection due to the activation of autophagy or 338 reduced autophagy-related protein turnover? Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) was used to 339 determine the cause for the increased level of LC3B-11. Baf A1 is a V-ATPase 340 inhibitor that inhibits autophagosome degradation by blocking the fusion of 341 autophagosomes with lysosomes, and we used it to monitor changes in autophagic 342 flux (Shacka et al., 2006). 343 The immunofluorescence and western blot data showed that the numbers of LC3B 344 puncta and the LC3B-II and SQSTM1/p62 protein expression levels were both 345 decreased in the Baf A1+HSV-2 treated group compared with puncta numbers and 346 expression levels in the Baf A1 group (Fig. 2), suggesting that autophagosome 347 turnover was blocked in the HSV-2-infected cells. Consistently, the protein expression 348 of autophagy-related Atg5 in the HSV-2-infected cells was decreased compared with 349 that in the control group cells. To better study the effect of HSV-2 infection on 350 autophagic flux, the VK2/E6E7 cells were transfected with the mRFP-GFP-LC3B 351 lentivirus, which served as a reporter of autophagic flux (Kimura et al., 2007). Since 352 the GFP signal is pH sensitive, this method can be used to quantify the number of 353 autophagosomes and autolysosomes. The yellow spots represent overlapping red and 354 green spots, indicating autophagosomes that have not fused with lysosomes, while the 355 red spots correspond to autolysosomes (Klionsky et al., 2016). Twenty-four hours 356 after infection, we found a marked increase in the number and proportion of yellow 357 puncta in the cells infected with HSV-2 compared with the number and proportion in 358 the nontreated cells (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicate that HSV-5. JZ-1 acts against HSV-2 infection and inhibits HSV-2-induced inflammatory 362 response by inducing autophagic flux 363 The levels of HSV-2 structural viral proteins, such as ICP5 and gD, can be 364 measured as representative of virus replicating events in the cell (Liu et al., 2016; 365 Peretti et al., 2005), and gD, as a major component of the virion envelope, has been 366 previously found to be essential for viral fusion and thus plays a vital role in the 367 cell-to-cell spread of the virus (Spear et al., 2000; Spear and Longnecker, 2003). The 368 results from the western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of ICP5 and 369 gD were increased in the HSV-2-infected cells, indicating enhanced viral replication.370However, the expression levels of ICP5 and gD were significantly reduced in the 371 JZ-1+HSV-2 treated group, suggesting that JZ-1 has an anti-HSV-2 effect(Fig. 4A\\n372and C). The TEM images showed that the JZ-1+HSV-2 group had more autophagic 373 vacuoles and autolysosomes than did the HSV-2 group(Fig. 3A). The374 mRFP-GFP-LC3B lentivirus reporter indicated a significant increase in the number of 375 autolysosomes in the JZ-1+HSV-2 group compared with those in the group treated 376 with only HSV-2 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the immunofluorescence and western blotting 377 results showed that the numbers of LC3B puncta and the expression levels of the 378 LC3B-II and SQSTM1/p62 protein were both increased in the 379 JZ-1+Baf+HSV-2-treated group compared with the numbers and levels in the\\n384we asked whether HSV-2 infection can be prevented by increasing autophagic flux?385    To explore the role of autophagy in anti-HSV-2 infection, we conducted a series of 386 experiments using an autophagy activator and inhibitor. Rapamycin (Rapa) is an 387 inhibitor of mTOR, which can induce an increase in autophagic flux, and388 3-methyladenine(3-MA) is an inhibitor of the class III PtdIns3K, which can block an 389 mRFP-GFP-LC3B lentivirus reporter to determine the number of autophagosomes 391 and autolysosomes. The number of autolysosomes increased after Rapa treatment in 392 the HSV-2 group and in the JZ-1 + HSV-2 group but decreased significantly after 393 3-MA treatment in both groups (Fig. 3B). Consistently, the immunofluorescence and 394 western blotting showed that the numbers of LC3B puncta and the LC3B-II and Atg5 395 protein expression levels were both increased in the Rapa+HSV-2 group but 396 decreased in the 3-MA+HSV-2 group (Fig. 5). The expression levels of virus proteins 397 ICP5 and gD were measured to evaluate the anti-HSV-2 effect, and the results showed 398 that, in Rapa+HSV-2 group, the expression levels of ICP5 and gD were decreased 399 compared with that in the HSV-2 group, while in the 3-MA+HSV-2 group, the levels 400 were further increased compared with that of the HSV-2 group. Moreover, the ICP5 401 and gD protein expression levels of the cells in the JZ-1+3-MA+HSV-2-treated group 402 were higher than those of the cells in the JZ-1+HSV-2 group (Fig. 5A and C), which 403 indicated that the inhibition of autophagy weakens the anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1. Our 404 results indicated that the activation of autophagy protected against HSV-2 infection 405 and that the anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was mediated by the induction of autophagic 406 flux. 407 Furthermore, HSV-2 infection induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, 408 including IFN-α, IFN-β and proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, TNF-α, which are 409 important innate immune factors against viral infection (Chew et al., 2009). Our 410 results showed that the cytokines IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-6 and TNF-α were all significantly 411 increased after HSV-2 infection, while JZ-1 attenuated this increase. Treatment with 412\\n6. JZ-1 induces autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway 416\\n426 LY294002 (LY) is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of PI3K, and it was found to 427 completely suppress the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis in cells (Han and 428 Zhang, 2010; Wu et al., 2009). To explore whether the regulation of the 429 PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is associated with autophagy induction, the VK2/E6E7 430 cells were pretreated with LY294002 for 2 h and then co-incubated with HSV-2 in the 431 absence or presence of JZ-1. The results from the western blot and qRT-PCR analyses 432\\n439 enhanced activity of JZ-1 on the autophagy. Based on the above results, it can be 440 inferred that JZ-1 can induce autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells by inhibiting the a linear, double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the subfamily of 445 α-Herpesviridae. Similar to most viruses, HSV-2 infects host cells following the key 446 steps: virus entry, viral gene expression, viral DNA synthesis, and assembly/egress of 447 progeny virions(Taylor et al., 2002). The virus is taken into the cell by direct fusion 448 with the cell membrane (independent of pH changes) or by endocytosis mediated by 449 specific cell receptors. Both gD and the ICP5 of HSV play essential roles in the two 450 uptake processes described above(Spear et al., 2000). Regardless, the binding of viral 451 glycoproteins to cell attachment sites, usually heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs),452    mediates the entrance of HSV-2(Shukla and Spear, 2001). It has been reported that 453 glycoproteins B and C (gB and gC) of HSV-2 are also necessary for the initiation of454 virus-to-cell attachment. Therefore, the expression levels of the related viral proteins 455 can represent the degree of virus infection and the activity of antiviral drugs. 456 Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process involving the 457 formation of a bilayer membrane structure called an autophagosome that 458 phagocytoses cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles and delivers them 459 to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy can be divided into three 460 classic types: chaperone-mediated autophagy, microautophagy and macroautophagy, 461 the most extensively studied autophagy (simply referred to as autophagy) (Deretic et 462 al., 2013). As one of the body's immune mechanisms against pathogen infection, 463 autophagy selectively recognizes and removes invading pathogenic microorganisms, 464 such as bacteria and viruses (Sui et al., 2017). Upon induction, phagophores elongate 465 and subsequently enclose a portion of the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of 466 autophagosomes. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome 467 (forming the autolysosome), in which the contents of the autophagosome are 468 degraded. In this process, the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex binds to the outer 469 membrane and then dissociates upon completion of the autophagosome. Upon 470 receiving the signal to induce autophagy, Atg7 and Atg3 mediate the conjugation of 471 LC3-I to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3B-II. LC3B-II 472 integrates into both the outer and inner membranes of the autophagosome and 473 facilitates membrane elongation and closure. SQSTM1/p62 is selectively incorporated 474 into autophagosomes through direct binding to LC3; at the end of autophagy, both 475 proteins are effectively degraded. The total cellular expression level of SQSTM1/p62 476 inversely correlates with autophagic activity, while the LC3B-II level positively 477 correlates with autophagic activity (Mizushima et al., 2010). As mentioned in the 478 Introduction, autophagy pathways and autophagy proteins play crucial roles in 479 combating viral infections. Several studies have found that repression of autophagy 480 led to increased viral replication and pathogenesis (Orvedahl et al., 2010), whereas its 481 activation decreased virus infection (Clark et al., 2018). 482 Different from many RNA viruses that induce autophagy and use membrane 483 structures to create scaffolds for virus replication or support the release of viral 484 particles during viral replication, many DNA viruses inhibit autophagy to prevent 485 their own intracellular degradation and phagocytosis or to damage MHC presentation 486 during antigen processing (Paul and Munz, 2016), especially herpesviruses, such as 487 the α-herpesvirus HSV-1 (Orvedahl et al., 2007), the murine γ-herpesvirus 68 488 (MHV-68) (E et al., 2009) and the β-herpesvirus HCMV (Mouna et al., 2016). 489 However, few studies have addressed the changes in autophagy induced by HSV-2. 490 Generally, increased LC3B-II levels with decreased SQSTM1/p62 levels are 491 considered to be the result of increased autophagy. In our study, we found the same 492 results: HSV-2 induces the accumulation of LC3B-II and increases the degradation of 493 SQSTM1/p62. Does this finding indicate that HSV-2 infection induces autophagic 494 flux? Through TEM observation, applying autolysosome inhibitor (Baf A1), and using 495 the lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B to track the LC3B marker, we assessed the 496 true influence of HSV-2 on autophagic flux. Compared with that of the group treated 497 with Baf A1 alone, the expression level of LC3B-II, SQSTM1/p62 and Atg5 in the 498 HSV-2 +Baf A1 group was reduced. In lentivirus experiments, the number of unfused 499 autophagosomes was significantly increased in the HSV-2-infected cells. These data 500 indicated that HSV-2 inhibits autophagic flux. As for explanations about LC3B-II 501 being elevated while SQSTM1/p62 is decreased in the HSV-2 infected cells, the 502 increased LC3B-II may be attributed to a partial block of autophagic flux in the 503 HSV-2-infected cells (degradation of LC3B-II is reduced), and SQSTM1/p62, which 504 has been decreased, may be degraded in pathways other than the autophagy pathway 505 (Barth et al., 2010; Moscat and Diaz-Meco, 2009).\\nAs an in-hospital preparation of Tongji Hospital (Approval Number: Z20103135),507    JZ-1 has been widely used for many years. JZ-1 is a prescription based on the 508 modification of Yihuang Tang. In Yihuang Tang, Dioscoreae Rhizoma, Euryales 509 Semen strengthen the spleen and reinforce the stomach, tonify the kidney and inhibit 510 leucorrhoea. Ginkgo Semen convergence and dehumidification, and can also arrest 511 leucorrhoea. Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex clears heat and resolves dampness to treat 512 the syndrome of dampness-heat in the lower jiao, and then, the Plantaginis Semen 513 clearing heat and promoting diuresis. The medicines described above are used 514 together, focusing on invigorating the deficiency, and supplemented by promoted 515 diuresis, they clear heat and eliminate dampness, thereby the deficiency of in the 516 kidney can be recovered, heat cleared and dampness dispelled; then, leucorrhea can 517 be cured. Genital herpes mostly presents with typical symptoms of dampness and heat.518 To strengthen their role in clearing heat and resolving dampness, medicinal 519 ingredients such as Solanum Nigrum, Taraxaci Herba, Herba Patriniae, and Moutan 520 Cortex are added, and those medicinal ingredients that based on tonifying and 521 promoting diuresis are removed. In the JZ-1 prescription, Phellodendri Chinensis 522 Cortex and Ginkgo Semen are used as monarch drugs; the minister drugs include 523 Solanum Nigrum, Taraxaci Herba, and Herba Patriniae; Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma, 524 Dictamni Cortex, and Moutan Cortex are assistant drugs; and Menthae Haplocalycis 525 Herba and Borneolum Syntheticum adjuvant drugs. 526 Many studies have shown that the main components of JZ-1, Phellodendri 527 Chinensis Cortex, Ginkgo Semen, Solanum Nigrum, Taraxaci Herba, Herba Patriniae, 528 Moutan Cortex or their extracts have a protective effect during virus infection. 529 Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex has various pharmacological actions, which have been 530 widely prescribed to remove damp heat, eliminate dampness, counteract toxicity, 531 purge pathogenic fire, relieve consumptive fever, diarrhea and other syndromes(Chen 532 et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex has the 533 immunomodulatory effects of a broad-spectrum antiviral activity by inducing an 534 antiviral state through a type I IFN stimulation mechanism (Kim et al., 2016). Ginkgo 535 Semen, which can converge and eliminate dampness and cure leucorrhoea, is a 536 potential phytomedicine with various pharmacologic effects, including 537 anti-inflammatory effects on inflammatory cells, beneficial effects on neuron 538 degenerative diseases through the prevention of chronic oxidative damage and useful 539 effects for the treatment of diseases related to the production of free radicals 540 (Yoshikawa et al., 1999). In addition, Ginkgo Semen can markedly reduce the 541 infectivity of viruses by preventing their adsorption onto host cells (Haruyama and 542 Nagata, 2013). The functions of Solanum Nigrum are heat-clearing, detoxification 543 and diuresis. Solanum Nigrum plays a role in viral clearance during natural HCV 544 infection, and it might be an alternative treatment for chronic HCV infection (Javed et 545 al., 2011). Taraxaci Herba has the ability to eliminate heat and toxins, as well as to 546 reduce swelling, choleresis, diuresis, and inflammation, and it can inhibit viruses by 547 suppressing viral nucleoprotein synthesis and polymerase activity(He et al., 2011). 548 Herba Patriniae can clear heat and induce detoxification, eliminating phlegm and 549 removing blood stasis, thereby promoting blood circulation. In the model of λ-lysogen, 550 which is used to study the inhibitory effects of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome 551 (SARS) conferred by traditional Chinese medicines, Herba Patriniae effectively 552 quenched the free radicals generated in the process of λ-lysogenic cells by UV 553 radiation, which suggests that Herba Patriniae is a potential Chinese medicine against 554 the SARS virus (Li et al., 2006). The function of Dictamni Cortex is to clear heat and 555 eliminate dampness, induce detoxification, clear hurricane and itching. The function 556 of Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma is dehumidification and detoxification. Moutan Cortex 557 has the function of clearing heat, cooling blood and removing blood stasis. It is used 558 in TCM as a hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory herb, which can effectively 559 prevent the entry of HCV and the related Zika flavivirus virus (Behrendt et al., 2017; 560 Poon et al., 2011). Menthae Haplocalycis Herba has the effect of dispelling wind and 561 heat, relieving sore throat, promoting eruption. All these medicines are used together 562 to treat abnormal leukorrhea and erosion of the vulva of genital herpes caused by 563 attack of wind, dampness, heat and toxin, and can achieve good antiviral effects. 564 Our results showed that JZ-1 could significantly reduce the expression of the 565 viral proteins gD and ICP5 in HSV-2-infected VK2/E6E7 cells, suggesting that it also 566 exerts a significant anti-HSV-2 effect. As the main active ingredient in Phellodendri 567 Chinensis Cortex, berberine can induce autophagy by activating the AMPK pathway 568 to inhibit mTOR signaling (Fan et al., 2015). Dandelion root extract has the potential 569 to induce autophagy (Ovadje et al., 2012). It has been shown that paeonol 570 (2'-hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone), isolated from the Moutan Cortex, can 571 up-regulate autophagy by activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, and the 572 autophagy inhibitor CQ notably attenuates paeonol-induced autophagy (Wu et al., 573 2017). Cao et al. proved that Ginkgo Semen leaf extract can restore autophagy 574 through inhibition of mTOR signaling (Cao et al., 2017). Based on this evidence, we 575 postulate that JZ-1 protects against HSV-2 by inducing autophagy, a supposition 576 confirmed in our later experiments. The TEM images, the mRFP-GFP-LC3B 577 lentivirus reporter observations and results from applying autolysosome inhibitor Baf 578 A1 showed that JZ-1 induces autophagy flux. To confirm whether JZ-1 exerts 579 antiviral effects by regulating autophagy, we treated cells with the autophagy inducer 580 Rapa and inhibitor 3-MA, which are widely used at the early stage of autophagy. 581 3-MA inhibits class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) as well as class III 582 PtdIns3Ks. Class I enzymes generate products such as PtdIns (3,4,5) P3, which inhibit 583 autophagic sequestration, whereas the class III product (PtdIns3P) generally 584 stimulates autophagic sequestration. 3-MA has different temporal patterns of 585 inhibition, causing long-term suppression of the class I PI3Ks but only transient 586 inhibition of the class III form of the enzyme. Therefore, the correct concentration and 587 incubation times are important for interpreting the final results. We conducted many 588 treatment duration and concentration experiments and pretreated the cells with 2.5 589 mM 3-MA for one-half hour finally. 590 One hypothesis has suggested that the antiviral response of autophagy is 591 controlled by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Shelly et al., 2009), which is known as 592 a key regulator of autophagy. Research has shown that HSV-2 infection results in the 593 activation of PI3K and Akt in the host cells, and BX-795 (a PI3K inhibitor) treatment HSV-2 infection. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy 600 induction by JZ-1 in the HSV-2 infection model, we assessed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 601 pathway in our study. Our results showed that the autophagy induced by JZ-1 might 602 be mediated upon inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The use of LY, a 603 specific inhibitor of PI3K, to block the JZ-1-induced autophagy confirmed this 604 molecular mechanism. Some limitations of our study are noted. For example, after 605 using LY, the expression of the HSV-2 virus proteins gD and ICP5 could have been 606 further explored to clarify the relationship between the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and 607 the virulence of the infection and the replication rate of HSV-2.608 609\\nconceived the idea and organized implementation.

       "       \"number of virus-interacting proteins (VIPs) with a specialized role in antiviral defense 19 have been shown to have exceptionally high rates of adaptation (Cagliani et al., 2012; 20 Cagliani et al., 2011; Elde et al., 2009; Fumagalli et al., 2010; Kerns et al., 2008; Liu et 21 al., 2005; Sawyer et al., 2004, 2007; Sawyer et al., 2005; Sironi et al., 2012; Vasseur et 22 al., 2011). One example is protein kinase R (PKR), which recognizes viral double-23 stranded RNA upon infection, halts translation, and as a result blocks viral replication 24 (Elde et al., 2009). PKR is one of the fastest adaptively evolving proteins in mammals.\\nSpecific amino acid changes in PKR have been shown to be associated with an arms26 race against viral decoys for the control of translation (Elde et al., 2009).\\nHowever, PKR and other fast-evolving antiviral defense VIPs are not representative of 28 the hundreds to thousands of other VIPs. Viruses enter and hijack the cells of their hosts 29 by physically interacting with hundreds to thousands of host proteins. Most VIPs are not\\nof the host (Dyer et al., 2008; Halehalli and Nagarajaram, 4\\nVIPs evolve unusually slowly (Davis et al., 2015; Jager et al., 2012). Furthermore, 11 very few cases of adaptation to viruses have been studied outside of fast evolving, 12 specialized antiviral proteins. Transferrin receptor or TFRC is the most notable 13 exception, as a striking example of a non-immune, housekeeping protein hijacked by 14 viruses (Demogines et al., 2013; Kaelber et al., 2012). TFRC is responsible for iron 15 uptake in many different cell types and is used as a cell surface receptor by diverse 16 viruses in rodents and carnivores. TFRC has repeatedly evaded binding by viruses 17 through recurrent adaptive amino acid changes. As such, it is the only known clear case 18 of a host protein with adaptation in response to viruses that is not specialized in the 19 antiviral response. Whether TFRC represents an exception or the rule for VIPs is 20 currently unknown.\\n21Whether the slower evolution of VIPs primarily reflects lower rates of adaptation, greater22 evolutionary constraint, or both is currently unknown. Here we analyze patterns of 23 evolutionary constraint and adaptation in a manually curated, high quality set of ~1,300 24 VIPs. The vast majority of these VIPs (80%) have no known antiviral or any other more 25 broadly defined immune activity. We confirm that VIPs tend to evolve slowly and show 26 that this is because VIPs experience stronger evolutionary constraint than other proteins 27 within the same functional categories. Most importantly, we show that despite this 28 greater evolutionary constraint, VIPs have experienced much higher rates of adaptation 29 in humans and other mammals compared to other proteins. This excess of adaptation is 30 visible in VIPs involved in most biological functions hijacked by viruses (such as 31 transcription or signal transduction), showing that adaptation in response to viruses 32 extends well beyond the usual, specialized antiviral proteins. We demonstrate that\\n12 interactions identified by high-throughput experiments as we are concerned about a high 13 rate of false positives (Mellacheruvu et al., 2013). These 1,256 VIPs were annotated 14 from an initial set of 9,861 proteins with orthologs in 24 mammals with high quality 15 genomes (Figure S1,\\n22recently, with half of all publications reporting VIPs published in the past 7 years (Figure 23S2), it is likely that additional VIPs remain to be discovered.\\nare involved in very diverse cellular processes, as shown by their 25 representation in the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation system of cellular biological 26 processes (2015; Ashburner et al., 2000) (\\nGenome Project are complementary for this analysis. On the one hand, the 1,000 24 Genomes Project provides high quality variants with frequencies estimated from a large 25 number of individuals. On the other hand the Great Ape Genome project includes fewer 26 individuals, but provides substantial pN and pS counts for more genes than the 1000 27 genomes data. This is because the great apes populations are more polymorphic than 28 modern human populations, and are less affected by the noise due to genetic drift and 29 strong bottlenecks. Thus, although the 1,000 genomes are well suited for approaches 30 requiring precise frequency estimates (such as the McDonald-Kreitman test 31implemented below(Messer and Petrov, 2013)), the Great Ape genome data is well\\nof the strength of purifying selection due to drift and bottlenecks (Prado-5 Martinez et al., 2013). We use only great ape pN and pS in the analyses that involve 6 subsamples of proteins in order to retain sufficient statistical power.\\npN/pS is 21% lower in VIPs compared to non-VIPs (0.759 versus 0.966, 9 95% CI [0.92,1.01], simple permutation test P=0 after 10 9 iterations). This suggests that10 in the human lineage VIPs have been under stronger purifying selection than non-VIPs.\\n13pN/pS ratio is 25% lower in VIPs compared to non-VIPs (0.526 versus 0.697, 95% CI14 [0.66,0.72], simple permutation test P=0 after 10 9 iterations). The distribution of pN/pS in 15 VIPs is globally skewed towards lower values compared to non-VIPs (Figure 1A). The 16 difference in pN/pS in great apes between VIPs and non-VIPs is robust to a number of 17 potentially confounding factors, including gene length, GC content and recombination 18(Table S7). These results show that VIPs do experience stronger purifying selection than 19 non-VIPs. Finally, stronger purifying selection acting on the VIPs is widespread and is 20 not limited to VIPs interacting with any one particular virus (Figure 1B).\\n29category. On average, pN/pS in the GO-matched non-VIPs is 0.647 (95% CI\\n621,0.674]). This is only slightly lower than the average ratio in non-VIPs in general 31 (pN/pS=0.697, P=2x10 -3 ), but much higher than the average ratio in VIPs (0.526,\\nfurther shows stronger purifying 11 selection in 124 of the 162 GO categories (77%) with more than 50 VIPs. These results 12 suggest that viruses target the most constrained proteins within many diverse host 13 functions, rather than specifically targeting only those host functions that are under 14 strong evolutionary constraint.\\nadaptation in VIPs in the human lineage 16 Our pN/pS analysis demonstrates that viruses tend to interact with proteins that are 17 under greater evolutionarily constraint. However, this does not necessarily imply that 18 VIPs experience less adaptation than non-VIPs. We estimate the proportion of adaptive 19 non-synonymous substitutions (noted α) in VIPs and non-VIPs in the human lineage by 20 using the McDonald-Kreitman test (MK test) (Methods). We first use the classic MK test 21 (McDonald and Kreitman, 1991) with the 1,000 Genomes Project polymorphism data 22 from African populations (Supplemental Methods and\\n30of adaptation compared to non-VIPs.\\nvariants and thus should show a stronger downward bias in the 6 estimation of α (Figure S3). However, the nominal estimates of α=0.19 and -0.02 in VIPs 7 and non-VIPs are likely underestimates of the true proportions of adaptive amino acid 8 changes.\\n19that both VIPs and non-VIPs in our dataset are limited to the proteins conserved across 20 all mammals.\\n30 test because it does not have sufficient precision when using a small number of proteins 31 (Supplemental Methods). Although the small number of proteins interacting with Likewise, VIPs in most GO categories show higher rates of adaptation (14 4 out of 20) with 9 of 14 showing statistically significant increases (Figure 1F).\\n13 selection within immune genes that would bias the MK tests downward (Cagliani et al., 14 2012). These results show that viruses have been a major selective pressure in human 15 evolution, and have had an influence on the rate of adaptation in the human proteome 16 that extends far beyond antiviral defense proteins, and on a much greater scale than 17 previously appreciated.\\n22VIPs we study are also VIPs in multiple mammalian lineages. Indeed, viruses infecting23 humans (including the ten viruses with the most VIPs) are known to have close viral 24 relatives in many other mammals, with the exception of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) for 25 which only distant relatives are known and primarily in bats (Quan et al., 2013). There is 26 also growing evidence that distantly related viruses tend to interact with overlapping sets 27 of host proteins (Davis et al., 2015; Jager et al., 2012). We thus hypothesize that VIPs, 28 while identified primarily in humans, may have also experienced frequent adaptation in 29 mammals in general, with the possible exception of the VIPs interacting with HCV.\\nTo test this hypothesis we use the Branch-Site Random Effect Likelihood test (BS-REL 31 test) (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011) available in the HYPHY package (Pond et al.,\\n12adaptation in the history of mammalian evolution. In addition to presence/absence of 13 adaptation, we assess the amount of adaptation experienced by a particular protein by 14 estimating the average proportion of selected codons along all mammalian branches.\\nexample we measure that on average the antiviral protein PKR has had 4.6% of 16 positively selected codons across the 44 branches of the mammalian tree.\\nWe compare the proportion of selected codons detected by the BS-REL test between18 VIPs and non-VIPs. The statistical power of the BS-REL test has been shown to depend 19 strongly on the amount of constraint in a coding sequence, with higher 20 constraint/purifying selection decreasing the ability to detect adaptation (Kosakovsky 21 Pond et al., 2011). We confirm this in our dataset by observing a strong positive 22 correlation between the pN/pS ratio in great apes and the proportion of selected codons\\n23across mammals estimated by the BS-REL test (Spearman's rank correlation ρ =0.34,24P<2x10 -16 , n=9,861). We therefore use a purifying selection-wise permutation test that 25 matches VIPs and non-VIPs with similar pN/pS ratios in order to compare VIPs and non-26VIPs that experience similar levels of purifying selection and providing us with similar 27 power to detect adaptation (Supplemental Methods andFigures S5 and S6).\\nwith the strongest evidence of adaptation (product of P-values lower than 10 -9 ) 4 have a ~200% excess of strong signals of adaptation. This excess of adaptation in VIPs 5 across mammals is due to i) more VIPs with signals of adaptation than non-VIPs, ii) 6 more branches of the tree per VIP showing adaptation, and iii) a greater proportion of 7 codons evolving adaptively per branch (Figure S7).\\nAs mentioned above, HCV stands out among the ten viruses with the largest number of9 VIPs in humans in that it has no known close viral relatives despite extensive screening 10 of diverse mammalian species (Quan et al., 2013). If this reflects a true lack of close viral 11 relatives of HCV, then we predict a limited excess of adaptation in HCV VIPs. In line with 12 this prediction, the 109 VIPs of HCV are the only ones where we do not detect any 13 excess of adaptation (Figure 2B) despite being one of the largest groups of VIPs. VIPs 14 that interact with all other viruses all show substantial elevation of adaptation (Figure 15 2B).\\nshow a 40% excess of 20 adaptation, and a ~130% excess of adaptation in the proteins with the highest evidence 21 of adaptation (Figure 2A). These results show that the arms race with viruses has 22 strongly increased the rate of adaptation in a wide range of VIPs.\\n29likely due to a lower statistical power of the BS-REL test in the short primate branches30 (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011). In line with this, VIPs with strong signals of adaptation 31 show such signals in all the mammalian clades represented (Figure 3).\\na wide range of mammals.\\nFrom global patterns of adaptation to understanding specific instances of 6 adaptation to viruses: the case of coronaviruses and aminopeptidase N 7 We have shown that rates of adaptation are globally elevated in VIPs in humans and 8 mammals in general, suggesting the existence of tens of thousands of isolated events of 9 adaptations to a diverse range of viruses. Here, we test if our global approach has 10 enough power to isolate new specific cases of adaptation to viruses by looking for 11 instances where viruses are the plausible cause of adaptation in a VIP with no known 12 antiviral activity. This is particularly relevant because, to our knowledge, the transferrin 13 receptor is the only well understood case of a non-antiviral protein adapting in response 14 to viruses (Demogines et al., 2013).\\n22 aminopeptidase N, abbreviated ANPEP, APN or CD13 (Mina-Osorio, 2008). The 23 analysis of a phylogenetic tree including 84 mammals(Table S11)confirms pervasive 24 adaptation of ANPEP across mammals, with 76 out of 165 branches in the tree evolving 25 adaptively (Figure 4A). ANPEP is a cell-surface enzyme well known for its surprisingly 26 wide range and diversity of functions (Mina-Osorio, 2008). It is used by group I 27 coronaviruses as a receptor, including the Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) 28 (Yeager et al., 1992), Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) (Delmas et al., 1992), 29 Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) (Tresnan and Holmes, 1998), Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) 30 (Tusell et al., 2007), Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV) (Delmas et al., 1993) and 31 Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) (Oh et al., 2003). Reguera et al. component of this contact surface for host tropism is a N-glycosylation 4 site at position 736 in porcine ANPEP (orthologous position 739 in human ANPEP) that 5 forms hydrogen bonds with TGEV and PRCV (Reguera et al., 2012; Tusell et al., 2007).\\nDeleting this site abolishes the ability of TGEV and PRCV to bind porcine ANPEP 7(Reguera et al., 2012). Adding the glycosylation site in human ANPEP that natively lacks 8 it transforms it into a receptor for TGEV and PRCV(Reguera et al., 2012).\\nWe use the MEME test from HYPHY(Murrell et al., 2012)  to identify codons in ANPEP 10 that were under episodic adaptive evolution in mammals. MEME detects significant11 adaptation (MEME P≤0.05) in 85 of the 931 aligned codons. Interestingly, several of 12 these adaptively evolving codons are within, or right next to the surface of contact with 13 TGEV and PRCV (Figure 4B,C). The codons in contact with TGEV and PRCV and their 14 neighbors are strongly enriched in adaptation compared to ANPEP codons as a whole 15 (Figure 4C). This enrichment fades very rapidly as one gets further from the surface of 16 contact with TGEV and PRCV, which shows that it is due to the interaction with viruses,17and not to a more diffuse, less specific enrichment within a wider segment of ANPEP 18 (Figure 4C).\\nAdaptively evolving codons in the contact surface with TGEV and PRCV most notably 20 include two codons within the consensus motif for the N-glycosylation site responsible 21 for host tropism (Figure 4B). N-glycosylation is governed by a three amino acids 22 consensus, NX[ST], where X can be anything except proline (Bause, 1983). The first 23 and third positions in the consensus evolved adaptively in mammals (MEME P=0.005 for 24 both). The ancestral states of the two positions shows that the mammalian ancestor had\\na fully functional consensus for N-glycosylation, and that the consensus was lost 26 independently 11 times in mammals, either by modification of the first or by modification 27 of the third position (\\n29 positions in the consensus mainly reflect parallel, adaptive losses of the N-glycosylation 30 site in multiple mammalian lineages. Given the crucial role of this N-glycosylation site in 31 the binding of TGEV, PRCV, FCoV and CCoV to ANPEP, it is very likely that these we have shown that viruses have been a major selective pressure in the evolution 4 of the mammalian proteome. Indeed viruses appear to drive ~30% of all adaptive amino 5 acid changes in the conserved part of the human proteome, as evidenced by the MK 6 test. Furthermore, the footprints of the arms race with viruses are visible in a large 7 number of VIPs, and in a broad range of mammals. Importantly, we find a substantial 8 enrichment in strong signals of adaptation in VIPs with no known antiviral or other 9 immune functions (Figures 1F and 2A). Instead adaptation to viruses is visible in VIPs 10 with a very diverse range of functions including such core functions as transcription or 11 signal transduction (Figure 2C and Table S3). Our results thus draw a broader picture 12 where the war against viruses is a global war that involves not only the specialized 13 soldiers of the antiviral response, but also the entire population of host proteins that 14 come into contact with viruses. The best-known case of a housekeeping protein having 15 adapted in response to viruses, the transferrin receptor, may in this respect represent 16 the rule more than an exception (Demogines et al., 2013).\\nhappen if we were getting close to the point where only few, hard to 22 discover VIPs remain to be found. This means that a substantial number of proteins 23 classified as non-VIPs in this analysis actually are VIPs. This makes the current non-24VIPs a conservative control.\\nSecond, adaptation in response to viruses is most likely not restricted to proteins that 26 physically interact with viruses. For example, adaptation to viruses might happen in 27 proteins that act downstream of VIPs in signaling cascades, or in non-coding sequences 28 that regulate the expression of VIPs.\\nThird, not all of the 1,256 VIPs we use here have been consistently interacting with 30 viruses during evolution. Most VIPs in the dataset (95%) were discovered in humans, evolutionary time in mammals, and only in a limited range of lineages. This 4 would apply to VIPs that interact with viruses with a limited host range and few other 5 phylogenetically closely related viruses, as is the case with HCV (Figure 2B).6Our analysis greatly extends the prospects for paleovirology by making it possible to7 detect past infections with great statistical power (Emerman and Malik, 2010; Patel et al., 8 2011). Indeed, globally increased adaptation in VIPs means that we have far more 9 statistical power to study the adaptive footprints viruses have left in host proteins. This is 10 a very complementary approach to the usual scans for integrated viral genomes in host 11 genomes, especially for viruses that do not infect the germ line or for viruses that 12 integrate in the host genome only rarely (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010). In the dataset 13 analyzed here, only HCV does not show any excess of adaptation in mammals. Two of 14 the ten viruses listed in Figure 2B, HIV-1 and HBV, have VIPs with highly increased 15 adaptation in humans. In other words, these results demonstrate that viruses related to 16 HIV-1 and HBV have repeatedly infected humans since their divergence with 17 chimpanzees. These results show that it should be possible to detect the footprint of 18 past infections by specific viruses in specific evolutionary lineages with great statistical 19 power.\\nGlobally increased adaptation in VIPs also raises the question of pleiotropy. To what 21 extent have adaptive amino acid changes in VIPs affected their native functions in the 22\\nfunctions, they elevate the rate of adaptation across the whole proteome in a 4 way that appears independent of specific functions in the GO analysis. We argue that 5 grouping genes together based on the way they interact with diverse pathogens or other 6 environmental stimuli might be a profitable way for discerning the nature of selective 7 pressures that have molded animal genomes.\\nIn conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that viruses have exerted a very powerful9 selective pressure across the breadth of the mammalian proteome, and suggests the 10 possibility that pathogens in general are the key driver of protein adaptation in mammals 11 and likely other lineages and might have driven many pleiotropic effects on diverse 12 biological functions.\\nwas performed by querying PUBMED for publications reporting 18 interactions found by low-throughput methods (Gray et al., 2015) 19 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).

The VIPs have ~15% lower mammals-wide dN/dS ratio on average compared to non-VIPs (0.124 versus 0.145, 95% CI [0.136,0.148]; Methods). The difference in dN/dS is highly significant as shown by a 11 permutation test where VIPs are compared with the same number of randomly chosen 12 non-VIPs many times (simple permutation test P=0 after 10 9 iterations;Table S2).\\n), we limit the effect of deleterious variants by excluding all variants with a derived allele frequency lower than 10% 26 (Supplemental Methods) (Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker, 2008; Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2009; Keightley and Eyre-Walker, 2007; Messer and Petrov, 2013) . We find that α is strongly elevated in VIPs compared to non-VIPs (α=0.19 in VIPs versus -0.02 in non-VIPs, permutation test P=2.x10 -5 ). This shows that VIPs have a substantial excess\\nWe thank Kerry Samerotte, Sandeep Venkataram, Emily Ebel and Pleuni Pennings for R01GM097415 to DAP.\\nCC-BY 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We cultured different cell lines (A549, BEAS-2B, MCF-7, HNEPC, HAE, and HBEC-3KT) in Matrigel, and then attempted to infect them with HRV-C and HBoV. Finally, we identified two types of human normal airway epithelial cells, HAE (primary cell line) and BEAS-2B cell (immortal cell line), that were suitable for 3D growth and for inoculation and isolation of the viruses. It is likely that the other cell lines (A549, MCF-7, HNEPC, and HBEC-3KT) no longer express the receptor or specific structures (such as cilia) required for respiratory virus invasion. The results of this study showed that both HRV-C and HBoV can propagate in 3D-cultured HAE cells (primary), but not well in BEAS-2B (immortal) cultures. This might be due to decreased differentiation ability and absence of specific features of organotypic tissue in the immortal cell lines, compared to those features in primary cell lines.',\n",

The spike glycoprotein on the virus particle interacts with host cell receptors to mediate fusion of the virus and host cell membranes and release of the positive-strand RNA genome into the cytoplasm. The 5 0 -proximal open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) are translated from the gRNA to generate the replicase polyprotein. The replicase polyprotein is processed by viral proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins which assemble with membranes to generate double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) where RNA synthesis takes place. A nested set of 3 0 co-terminal subgenomic (sg) RNAs is generated by a discontinuous transcription process. The sgRNAs are translated to generate the viral structural and accessory proteins. Viral gRNA is replicated and associates with nucleocapsid protein and viral structural proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where virus particles bud into vesicles before transport and release from the cell.

The green fluorescence represents the expressed pAPN protein; (D) The binding between five truncated S1 variants and pAPN-expressing cells was investigated by performing flow cytometry. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a pAPN gene-containing plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were resuspended with the S19-638, S253-638, S1-434, S253-533, and S477-629 proteins (50 μg/mL), followed by treatment with FITC-labeled anti-human IgG4 Fc antibodies. Then FACS was performed. pAPN-transfected cells untreated with protein (grey shade) or treated with IgG4 Fc protein (green shade) were used as controls; (E) An ELISA was performed to detect the binding between five truncated S1 variants and pAPN, IgG4 Fc protein was used as a control. ELISA plates were coated with S19-638, S253-638, S1-434, S253-533, S477-629, or IgG4 Fc proteins and blocked with BSA. The plates were then incubated with the pAPN protein. The TMB substrate was added after incubation with mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. The experiment was carried out three times, and the data from a representative experiment are shown. Error bars indicate the standard errors of the means.\\nComparison of pAPN-binding activity between CV777 and CHGD-01. (A) Sequence alignment of the CHGD-01 S253-638 and the CV777 S249-634 was carried out by ClustalW. The different residues are shown in red; (B) Purified proteins of the CV777 S249-634 and the CHGD-01 S253-638 with a C-terminal IgG4 Fc tag were detected by SDS-PAGE; (C) The binding of the CV777 S249-634 or the CHGD-01 S253-638 with pAPN-expressing cells was investigated by flow cytometry.

B The combination ofIarge scale and high stakes means that even small improvements in the quality of critical care might save many lives. In eight large states, we estimated that every year 4,000 mechanically ventilated patients die who might have been saved had they been in another hospital.\" Half of those patients died in a low-volume hospital within 5 miles of a high-volume center. Krumholz and colleagues\\'? have estimated that an additional 10,000 acute myocardial infarction patients might be saved annually if they received the same quality of care as provided by better hospitals. Of note, these lives might be saved using existing technology and knowledge without discovering new therapies.\\'!\\nApplication of Network Concepta to Public Health Problema in Critical Care\\nThe network representation facilitates simulation of closure of a hospital to outside transfers. We perform a first-order simulation, holding all other relationships constant. We assume that patients are redistributed to other hospitals in the state proportionately to their previous acceptance. Thus, hospital No. 1 transferred out three fee-for-service Medicare patients, one of whom went to No. 20. In simulating the quarantine of hospital No. 20, this implies that the two other hospitals to which No.1 transferred would each receive 0.5 additional patients.\\nHospital: In the event that the ICU in a central hospital was to close to outside transfers as in quarantine for SARS, we can simulate the results ofthe increased burden that would fall on other hospitals in the state if no new transfer rela-Connectivity: About 77% (23 of 30) hospitals both send and receive critically ill transfers, showing little support for hypothesis HI (secondary or tertiary).

Only 10% of hospitals (3 of 30 hospitals) transfer to just one hospital; 23% of hospitals (7 of 30 hospitals) transfer critically ill patients to 2: 5 other hospitalswithin Connecticut. Again, there is little support for hypothesis H2 (satellitesof a single center).\\n, we quarantine hospital No. 20, which had received 126 Medicare ICU transfers from within the state during 2005.

The edges denote contacts, where the actions are indicated by the edge-end types, social distancing | and interaction \\uf066. Given the state of the disease and contact network at time t, individuals decide to take preemptive measures or not at time t+ which determines the state of each individual at time t + 1 according to the Markov chain dynamics in (7). If a i = 1, individual i does not take any preemptive measures. If a i = 0, i self-isolates reducing any risk of disease contraction or spread to zero. A healthy individual can only contract the disease from an interaction with a neighbor if and only if the individual's neighbor is infected and neither of the two self-isolates. These interactions are marked by a red dot in the middle figure. We enumerate each pair of state and action in (b).\\nBehavior and disease dynamics with respect to payoff constants.

For c 2 = 0, we have the red circled points corresponding to the R 0 upper bound when there is no behavior response by the initial sick individual. Note that all the red circled points indicate R 0 > 1.

The runs start with a single infected individual and all individuals infected respectively for the top and bottom figures. In each plot, the axes correspond to the constant values of c 1 and c 2 . For a given value of c 1 and c 2 , we generate 50 scale-free networks using the preferential attachment algorithm and run the stochastic network disease game for 200 steps for each network. The grid color represents the ratio of runs in which disease is eradicated within 200 steps.

Map showing the geographical distribution of hMPV genotypes among humans. Human metapneumovirus isolates are divided into four major subgroups (A1, A2, B1, and B2) and each has its own geographical localization.\\nMolecular events in the pathogenesis of hMPV infection. Virus attachment to toll-like receptors (TLR) of macrophage and/or dendritic cells activates several adapter molecules of the immune system (TRIF and MYD88), which in turn activates Nuclear factor kappa beta (NFkb). RNA of internalized virus is detected by cytoplasmic RIG1-like receptor (RLR), which in turn activates NFkb by activation of mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) and transcription activators interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF-3 and IRF-7). Finally NFkb and IRFs induce the production of several interferons and interleukins.\\nDifferent treatment strategies under development for the prevention of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection Ribavirin along with intravenous immunoglobulin was found to have antiviral activity against hMPV in vitroHumanOral ribavirin combined with intravenous immunoglobulin led to rapid and complete recovery in an immunocompromised child who was undergoing chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma Mice Human monoclonal antibody was able to cross-neutralize hMPV and hRSV and may be used as prophylaxis and therapy for severe hRSV and hMPV SiRNA targeting P and N genes of hMPV was able to inhibit replication of all subgroups of HMPV in vitroMice Dicer substrate SiRNA reduced lung viral titre post-challenge in mice 91 Inactivated vaccine Heat inactivated vaccine Mice Immunization gave protective immunity against a homologous strain of hMPV followed by intranasal challenge in BALB/c mice Epitope vaccine T lymphocyte epitope vaccine Mice Immunization reduced viral load, lung pathology, and expression of Th2-type cytokines (IL-10, IL-4) after hMPV challenge Intranasal immunization of African green monkeys induced hMPVspecific humoral and cell-mediated immune response and complete protection from wild-type hMPV challenge.

       "       \"A single observed genealogy is consistent with multiple observed transmission processes.\\nFigure 1. Identifying 'who infected whom' often requires more detailed contact information than is needed at the scales most amenable to phylogeographic approaches (Great Britain scale map, left). At finer scales (right), there are two types of information: genetic information from sampled pathogens (where samples are indicated by red circles) provides direct insight into the transmission network indicated by the red arrows, whereas the possibly bidirectional purple arrows represent the social network (or denominator data). Both help to reconstruct the true transmission tree (red arrows), but deviate from it in different ways. The social network may contain many links that do not cause transmission. By contrast, the transmitted genotypes (blue circles) are indicative of the transmission tree but, especially when mutation rates are low compared to generation times, may lack informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; where the filled circles represent at least one additional mutation, but the open blue circle in C indicates a type identical to what is found in B). A pooled sample from D (broken oval encompassing samples from two lineages) could generate a consensus sequence that is not representative of either transmitting lineage, but these could be recovered by the existence of two divergent sequences that could be identified via deep sequencing.\\nPhylodynamic reconstruction of a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic. (A) Identified likelihood that a particular infected premises was the source of another infected premises based on a space-time-genetic model. Circle size is proportional to the relative likelihood of that event. (B) Spatial relationships among premises in the dataset. Reproduced from[11], with permission of the corresponding author.\\nFigure 3. Biased sampling for multi-host systems causes problems for interpretation of genetic data even where the density of samples in one host is very high. The trees in the figure depict phylogenies of a pathogen in a two-host system; circles represent sampled sequences from the red or blue species. (A) For low mixing, random sampling reveals the relationship between the two host species but has a high probability of missing rare crossover events (red star). By contrast, dense sampling of one host (in red) will miss the existence of the second host species unless the crossover event is sampled, in which case the long branch length associated with it is instructive. By contrast, in (B) the distribution of branch lengths under biased sampling reveals the presence of unsampled events, although the nature of those events would not be determined by phylogenies alone. In (C), where mixing is substantial, the absence of data from the hidden host is likely unobserved or interpreted as greater variability in the mutation rate. It would be quickly revealed by even moderate sampling, although the phylogeny would remain difficult to distinguish from the case of a spillover host. The trees were created and displayed using a custom R script; random trees were created with the ape package, and a two-host discrete traits model was used with the package phytools to generate the ancestral and tip states.\\nPathogen emergence or spillover? The figure represents the infection of horses by an avian pathogen. In (A), black arrows represent an avian virus that is introduced multiple times (spillover) but cannot be transmitted among horses, whereas (B) represents a single introduction event followed by onward transmission.

The cells were further shaken at 28°C for 2 h with 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to produce the recombinant protein. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of solution L (50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 pH 7.0, and 300 mM NaCl) containing 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 ll/ml of Protease Inhibitors Cocktail for purification of Histidine-Tagged Proteins (Sigma), and sonicated 4 times in ice-cold water using a Bioruptor (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) at 200 W for 30 s each time with a 120-s interval.

The final concentration of the enzyme (10 to 170 nM for the mutant protease) and the digestion time (15 to 90 min) varied because the cleavage activity differed for each substrate. After the reaction, aliquots were analyzed by HPLC. The initial digestion rates were calculated from the decrease in the peak area of each substrate. K m was calculated from the plot of [S]/v vs. [S], where [S] is the concentration of the substrate and t is the initial reaction rate.

       "       'siRNA-SWNT preparation and characterization. a Two sets of siRNA sequences targeting the GFP gene of transgenic mGFP5 Nicotiana benthamiana were separately tested in this study. Sequences on the left were chosen from Tang et al.\\nSupplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) suspended SWNTs reveals an average ssRNA-SWNT conjugate length of 776.6 nm and an average conjugate height of 1.567 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1), which agrees with the expected values for undamaged and individually suspended ssRNA-SWNTs. We first tested the internalization of ssRNA-SWNTs into intact mGFP5 Nb leaf cells. All internalization studies were performed with a-antisense-SWNT suspension as a representative strand to demonstrate the internalization ability of single-stranded RNA loaded SWNTs into intact walled plant leaf cells. Cy3 fluorophore-tagged RNA-SWNTs (100 nM siRNA and 2 mg/L SWNTs) and Cy3 tagged free RNA (100 nM) solutions were introduced into the intact plant leaves by infiltrating the abaxial surface of the leaf lamina with a needleless syringe (Fig. 2a).

All scale bars are 20 µm.\\nSupplementary Fig. 5), further substantiating efficient internalization of SWNTs into intact plant cells. No co-localization was observed in leaves treated with unlabeled free RNA. The internalization of SWNT nanocarriers into plant cells is also supported by the nIR fluorescence spectra of ssRNA-SWNTs. Compared to as-prepared ssRNA-SWNTs, the nIR fluorescence spectra of ssRNA-SWNTs infiltrated into leaves shows a 6-nm solvatochromic shift, and a relative change in intensity of small bandgap nanotubes upon cell membrane crossing (Supplementary Fig. 5). These differences in SWNT nIR spectra upon infiltration into leaves are possibly the result of the local dielectric environment change and exposure to intracellular biomolecules\\n, double-stranded active siRNA can merge with the gene silencing complex, whereby the antisense strand of siRNA directs the complex to the endogenous target mRNA. Upon hybridization of the antisense strand with the complementary target mRNA, a protein in the gene silencing complex (Argonaute), cleaves the target mRNA and prevents translation of GFP proteins(Fig. 3b).\\nThermodynamic analysis of RNA desorption from SWNTs and hybridization in extracellular and intracellular conditions, and proposed gene silencing mechanism. a An equimolar mixture of sense-SWNT and antisense-SWNT suspensions are infiltrated into transgenic Nb leaves with a needleless syringe. In the extracellular area of leaf tissue, RNA desorption and hybridization is not thermodynamically favorable due to the high free energy cost of bare SWNTs. b Inside cells, RNA desorption from SWNTs and hybridization is thermodynamically favorable because molecules can occupy the bare SWNT surface and lower the RNA desorption free energy cost.

The seeds were germinated and grown in SunGro Sunshine LC1 Grower soil mix for four to six weeks before experiments in a growth chamber, 12-hour light at 24°C and 12-hour dark at 18°C cycle. All experiments were done with intact leaves attached to plants, where plants were incubated in the growth chamber until the time of data collection. RNA-SWNT and Cy3-RNA-SWNT preparation. SWNTs were suspended with singlestranded RNA polymers or Cy3-tagged single-stranded RNA sequences through probetip sonication as previously described (50). See Supplementary Table 3 for all RNA sequences used in this study. Briefly, RNA was dissolved in 0.1 M NaCl at a concentration of 100 mg/mL. 1 mg dry HiPCO SWNTs was added to 20 μ L of dissolved RNA, and the solution volume was completed to 1 mL with 0.1 M NaCl. The mixture of SWNTs and RNA was bath sonicated for 10 min at room temperature. Then it was probe-tip sonicated with a 3-mm tip at 50% amplitude (~7W) for 30 min in an ice bath.\\nIn terms of siRNA yield, after the probe-tip sonication, centrifugation and removal of free RNA, we end up with 640 μ g/mL RNA on SWNTs, meaning that our RNA yield 32%. These values can slightly change from experiment to experiment, therefore, we made sure to use the same final diluted concentration of siRNA-SWNTs for every experiment at 100 nM siRNA and 2 mg/L SWNT. AFM characterization. AFM characterization of RNA-SWNTs was performed as described in(24).Infiltration of leaves withRNA-SWNTs and control solutions. Healthy and fullydeveloped leaves from mGFP5 Nicotiana benthamiana (4-6 weeks old) plants were selected for experiments. A small puncture on the abaxial (bottom) surface of the leaf was introduced with a pipette tip, and ~100 μ L of the RNA-SWNT solution was infiltrated from the hole with a 1 mL needleless syringe with caution not to damage the leaf.\\nused to image the plant tissue with 488 nm laser excitation with a eGFP filter cube to detect intracellular GFP, and 543 nm laser excitation with an appropriate filter cube to detect Cy3 fluorescence. The emission window of Cy3 was adjusted to 550-600 nm to avoid crosstalk between Cy3 and leaf chlorophyll autofluorescence. For nIR imaging, 40 mg/L RNA-SWNTs were infiltrated into leaves and plants with attached infiltrated leaves were left in the plant growth chamber to allow for internalization for 6 h, and imaged with nIR microscopy to track intrinsic SWNT nIR fluorescence in leaves. RNA-SWNT leaf internalization images were captured using a custom-built microscope equipped with a Raptor Ninox VIS-SWIR 640 camera. A 1050nm long pass filter was used to avoid chlorophyll autofluorescence, and a white lamp with an appropriate filter cube was used to image GFP. GFP and Cy3 (or nIR) images were analyzed with the ImageJ co-localization program to demonstrate internalization ofRNA-SWNTs into cells.In vitro RNA hybridization and desorption assay. a-sense-SWNT and a-antisense-SWNT solutions were prepared according to \"RNA-SWNT and Cy3-RNA-SWNT preparation\" section. Equimolar mixtures of these suspensions each containing 600 ng/μL RNA on SWNTs were either incubated in water or in plant cell lysate for 3 h at room temperature to allow for hybridization and desorption. Next, hybridized doublestranded RNA in solution was eluted with 100K spin filters and the concentration of RNA in the elute was measured via absorbance at 260 nm with Nanodrop.

Confocal imaging for silencing and quantitative fluorescence intensity analysis of GFP expression. mGFP5 Nb leaves were infiltrated with s-RNA-SWNT, free siRNA, a-siRNA-SWNT, and b-siRNA-SWNT at the same RNA concentration of 100 nM and SWNT concentration of 2 mg/L. Infiltrated plant leaves were prepared for confocal imaging 1, 2, 3, and 7-days post-infiltration as described in (24). For each sample, mean fluorescence intensity value was normalized with respect to the mean GFP fluorescence intensity of a non-treated leaf.

Published by Oxford University Press.\\nHuman outbreak map and phylogeny of filoviruses. Using just the concatenated coding regions of the 34 one-per-outbreak sequences from the database (excluding the non-coding regions as they vary in length, and are very difficult to reliably align across species), we reconstructed the phylogeny of all filovirus outbreak sequences (see also Supplementary Figure S1), using the PHYML web interface provided through the HFV database (37) (http://hfvdev.lanl.gov:9100/content/sequence/PHYML/interface.html). Here, the year and the country name for each sequence are given to highlight the timing of a source of the sampled outbreak. Details concerning the sequences included in this tree and phylogenetic methods are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. If a virus was contracted by an individual while visiting a country, but discovered upon return to their own county, it is labeled with an arrow. For example a South African was infected with Marburg virus while visiting Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1975, and so the taxon representing this infection is labeled 'ZW ->ZA 1975'  where ZW is the ISO 2 letter code for Zimbabwe, ZA is the code for South Africa, and 1975 is the year of sampling. It corresponds to the point in Zimbabwe on the Marburg inset map, labeled 1975. Of note, if the year of sampling of the sequence in the tree is later than a corresponding year in the map, it is because the disease outbreak spanned a year. For example, the 2013-15 EVD outbreak in Western Africa began with an index case infected in December 2013, so it is labeled 2013 on the map; as the first samples that were sequenced were obtained in March 2014, 2014 is indicated in the tree. The geographic source of each sequence and the time of sampling were used to associate the sequences with the disease outbreak lists (CDC links). Several of the human disease outbreaks listed by the CDC did not have a corresponding sequence, and those are noted with a year in the map, but are represented as open oval; filled ovals represent disease outbreaks with a corresponding sequence. In some cases the precise location of an outbreak is not known; for instance, the location within Uganda where the African Green Monkeys that first carried MARV to Germany is just represented by a point in Uganda; some outbreaks were only noted to be within a particular province. Viruses from different species are assigned different colors, and clades representing phylogenetically closely related sequences are indicated by similar colors.\\nS5 A. World Map, S5 B.

The three methods combined found 6 sites of positive selection, supported by two or all three methods, in or very close to the mucin-like domain region, in codon positions 309, 310, 318, 332, 403, 430, relative to EBOV Mayinga reference isolate.\\nVirus variability across filovirus species of MAb MR78 epitope. Discontinuous positions of MAb MR78 epitope are shown. A Sequence\\nPremade filovirus sequence alignmentsWhole-genome as well as individual gene and protein sequence alignments are available for all filoviruses, as well as separate alignments for ebolavirus and marburgvirus sequences. Automated alignment using MAFFT(31) serves as a basis for these alignments, which are hand checked to determine if both the boundaries of internal gap regions and boundaries encompassing codon regions are sensible, and to resolve obvious errors. Filovirus reference sequences (2) for the viruses belonging to each of the known Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus species were used as the basis for the within species virus alignments; the species virus alignments were then aligned to each other, using the Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-Mayinga isolate (NC_002549) as the master reference sequence. The comprehensive alignments contain all fulllength sequences available up to the last database update. The species reference alignments contain only eight filovirus reference sequences(2). The 'outbreak' filovirus alignments contain 34 sequences, each representing a virus that seeded a distinct human EVD or MVD\\nSequence differences between outbreaks within and\",\n",

       "       \"Incidental infections of humans by avian influenza viruses have been documented for avian influenza subtypes A/H5N1, A/ H7N2, A/H7N3, A/H7N7, A/H9N2, A/H10N7 and A/H11N9. Recent outbreaks of ''bird flu'' may foreshadow an eventual pandemic outbreak, in the emergence of strains and variants with enhanced pathogenicity, virulence and transmissibility in human hosts. Examples of such outbreaks include A/H5N1 Hong Kong, 1997; H9N2 Hong Kong, 1999; A/H7N7 Netherlands, 2003; A/ H5N1 Southeast Asia, 2004. Some avian A/H5 and A/H7 strains of influenza virus are recognized as highly pathogenic (HP) in domestic poultry and concerns arise that this phenotype may carry over to infections of humans. Since 1997, human infections associated with the Eurasian-African lineage of A/H5N1 HP avian influenza virus have been associated with 467 documented cases in 15 countries with high mortality (282 deaths) [2; updated 30 December 2009].\\nillustrates the pathogen gene re-sequencing capacity of the RPM-Flu assay as both complementary strands of 117,254 bp of gene sequences, distributed across 188 detector tiles, representing 30 different categories of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens.

The 25 A/H3N2-positive clinical specimens from the ensemble of 298 specimens described in the preceding section were collected between January 2007 and March 2007, at five different military basic training venues (Great Lakes Naval Training Station, IL; Marine Corps Recruit Depot, CA; Army Fort Leonard Wood, MO; Army Fort Jackson, SC; Army Fort Benning, GA). All but one of the RPM-Flu assay-generated HA3 gene sequences were most similar to BLAST-returned sequence records of A/H3N2 isolates that Nelson et al [11] associated with either major ''clade a'' from the 2006-2007 influenza outbreaks in the United States, or from the ''N-lineage clade'', a lineage originating from the 2005-2006 influenza season and continuing to circulate nationwide during the 2007-2008 season. The HA3 gene sequence from a single A/H3N2 specimen was found to be most similar to sequence records that Nelson et al [11] associated with the 2006-2007 ''minor clade b''. This minor clade b to represents a subpopulation of amantadine-sensitive A/H3N2 strains, in contrast to the resistant phenotype of the strains with the majority of circulating N-and a-clade strains.\\nSubtype A/H1N1 influenza virus and neuraminidase NA1 gene-based resistance to oseltamivir-like antivirals. The five A/H1N1-positive clinical specimens from the ensemble of 298 specimens described in the preceding section were collected between January 2007 and March 2007, at two different military basic training venues (Army Fort Jackson, SC; Army Fort Benning, GA). BLAST analysis of the five RPM-Flu-detected HA1 gene sequences returned most similar reference sequence records including those that Nelson et al. [11] associated with A/ H1N1 Major Clade A from the 2006-2007 outbreaks of influenza in the United States. Global surveillance during the two most recent influenza seasons (2007-2009) has revealed\\n, the RPM-Flu assay-generated NA1 gene sequences from the older ensemble of clinical specimens (2006-2007) were concordant with those of the oseltamivir-sensitive, A/New Caldedonia/20/1999 (H1N1) RPM-Flu detector tile strain. BLAST analysis of these NA1 gene sequences returned most similar records including the oseltamivir-sensitive A/Ohio/UR06-0591/2007 and A/Oregon/ UR06-0609/2007 strains.

The older specimens have NA1 gene sequences that are concordant with those of the oseltamivir-sensitive, A/New Caldedonia/20/1999 (H1N1) RPM-Flu detector tile strain, including the determinant -CAT-histidine (H) codon at peptide position 275 (aligned locus in red box). BLAST analysis of these NA1 gene sequences returned most similar records including the oseltamivir-sensitive A/Ohio/UR06-0591/2007 and A/Oregon/UR06-0609/2007 strains. The '@' symbol in the inset indicates the C-T transition mutations encoding tyrosine (Y) at this locus of more recent strains such as A/South Carolina/06/2008 and A/Texas/16/2008. Three specimens (NHRC_413, _415, and _418) were also collected in 2008, and these failed to generate sequence through this locus from the oseltamivir-sensitive detector tile genotype. These results do not explicitly corroborate the H275Y resistance genotype, although they are consistent with diminished re-sequencing efficiency at sites of mismatching detector tile and specimen gene sequences. These runs of N-calls suggest two or more proximal nucleotide mismatches may be present at this NA1 gene locus of the selected NHRC 2008 specimens. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008995.g004\\nLimit of Detection (LoD) determination for seasonal A/H1N1 strain BRD10622.

Reference control templates as mixtures of the A/H1N1, A/ H3N2, and B strains of influenza virus were from live virus preparations (Influenza Virus Vaccine Live, Intranasal, FluMist, 2004-2005 Formula; MedImmune Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), or from inactivated virus preparations (Influenza Virus Vaccine [Fluvirin] Purified Surface Antigen Vaccine, 2006-2007 Formula, Package Insert; Chiron Corporation/Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., Emeryville, CA). Synthetic DNA preparations were purchased from Blue Heron Biotechnology (Bothell, WA) as templates to represent other type A influenza hemagglutinin (H2, andH4through H16) and neuraminidase (N3 through N9) gene sequences, as well as other pathogen gene sequences that are used as detectors on the RPM-Flu array. In some cases, the NRL group outsourced (Macrogen USA, Gaithersburg, MD) corroborative de novo gene sequence determinations from amplified products from hemagglutinin (HA), matrix (M), neuraminidase (NA), nonstructural (NS1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit (PB2) genes.\\nThe TessArray RPM-Flu 3.1 allocates 40 detector tiles (41,063 bp) that represent influenza virus hemagglutinin genes (16 type A and 1 type B) and neuraminidase genes (9 type A and 1 type B), matrix genes (3 type A and 1 type B), and also the conserved NS and PB2 genes of avian influenza virus strain A/H5N1.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for seasonal A/H1N1 and seasonal A/H3N2 influenza viruses are presented as the number of tissue culture (TCID 50 ) or egg culture (EID 50 ) infectious units used for each assay that are demonstrated to result in .95% positive assay outcomes. The relation of tissue culture and egg culture infectious units typically vary with respect to specific influenza virus strain and inoculum. For this table an estimated ratio of 16 EID 50 : 1 TCID 50 is based upon results of testing the same A/Hawaii/15/2001 (H1N1) strain by both the JBAIDS and CDC rRT-PCR panels. The recently FDA-cleared 510(k)080570 the ''CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel'' is a test designed to specifically detect contemporary A/H1, A/H3 and A/H5 (Asian Lineage) influenza viruses in humans, as accessed 02 Oct 2009 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf8/ k080570.pdf. In characterizations of analytical sensitivity of this test panel, the CDC has reported analytical LoD in terms of egg culture infectivity titers (EID 50 /ml). The Department of Defense Joint Biological Agent Identification & Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) has implemented the same RT-PCR test and reported LoD in TCID 50 units of cell culture infectivity, as accessed 02 Oct 2009 at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/Safety/EmergencySituations/UCM180067.pdf. We estimate CDC rRT-PCR LoD results shown in Table 7 using TCID 50 units based on the results of both CDC and JBAIDS for A/Hawaii/15/2001(H1N1). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008995.t007pairs). While this RT-PCR panel may infer influenza virus subtype, not even testing for the NA component, the assay result is only based on a pattern of signals from a small panel of RT-PCR primer-probes.Some RT-PCR protocols require serial analysis with hierarchical panels of primer-probes in order to expand the practical multiplicity of pathogen targets or variants. This is the case with the benchmark PCR testing used in this report -a type A influenza virus-positive specimen may be identified in a first round RT-PCR panel, followed by testing with another panel to distinguish A/H1 from A/H3. Failure to establish subtype A/H1 or A/H3 in the follow-on test is a first tier screening results forpossible identification of the 2009 Novel A/H1N1 influenza virus outbreak strain. According to the FACT SHEET FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS: INTERPRETING CDC HUMAN INFLUENZA VIRUS REAL-TIME RT-PCR DETECTION AND CHARACTER-IZATION PANEL FOR RESPIRATORY SPECIMENS (NPS, NS, TS, NPS/TS, NA1) AND VIRAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS (Authorized by FDA 02 May 2009), ''The rRT-PCR Flu Panel (NPS, NS, TS, NPS/TS, NA) should be ordered to diagnose influenza A infections caused by influenza A or B and subtype determination of seasonal human influenza A virus (seasonal A/H1 or A/H3) to be used as a first tier test for the in vitro qualitative detection of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in patients suspected of having novel influenza A (H1N1) infection.

       "       \"FIG 1. Innate recognition of viral pathogen-associated pattern molecules. Interferon (types I and III) production in response to viral respiratory tract infection can be triggered by recognition of (1) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the cytosolic receptors melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or (2) dsDNA (B-DNA) by DAI or as yet unknown cytosolic DNA receptors (DNA-RX; not depicted). This recognition leads to the activation of interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF)-3 through the kinase TANK-binding kinase (TBK)-1 (or IKKi) and stimulates the production of interferons (types I and III) at the site of infection. RIG-I is also triggered by 59-pppRNA transcribed from dsDNA by using RNA polymerase III. In addition, ligation of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 by respective viral molecules triggers type I interferon production by means of signaling through adaptor molecules, including MyD88, Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (TRIF). The association of these adaptors with TBK1 ultimately results in the activation of the IRF family members (ie, IRF3/5/7) and, in some instances, nuclear factor kB, leading to the transcription of interferon genes (types I and III) and proinflammatory cytokines, such as pro-IL-1b, pro-IL-18, and IL-6. Of note, the production of interferons (types I and III) can be amplified by a positive feedback loop in which the interferons produced early trigger transcription in both autocrine and paracrine fashions.\\nProposed pathway for NLRP3 inflammasome activation during viral respiratory tract infection.\\nRole of innate and adaptive immune cells during pulmonary virus infection\\nDamage-associated host-derived components play a significant role in orchestrating host antiviral immune responses. The host adaptive immune response, including the CTL-mediated response and B cell-mediated humoral responses, is crucial to clear virus in the infected lung. The host's respiratory epithelium and immune response cooperate to restore lung function and homeostasis after viral infection. The general idea of the stem cells responsible for restoring respiratory epithelial complexity is known. ILCs are potent producers of type II cytokines, which might have implications for tissue repair and asthma. Viral infections result in a number of disease maladies not necessarily dependent on active viral replication.

In May 2011, the FilmArray respiratory panel (FA-RP) was FDA cleared for the detection of 17 respiratory viral pathogens, including Influenza A (H1-2009, H3, H1, and \"not subtyped\")/B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E), human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (including subtype 1, 2, 3, and 4), and three bacteria (Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). The turnaround time using this panel is approximately 1 hour; thus, this technique can ease the rapid and accurate identification of the pathogens causing UP. 4 With the increasing implementation of the FA-RP in clinical microbiology laboratories, further studies are required to determine the clinical diagnostic ability of the method and its influence on patient outcomes and antimicrobial usage. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of FA-RP on UP patient treatment compared with conventional methods. To this end, we prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with UP and analyzed the pathogen detection ability of the FA-RP. Moreover, we evaluated the clinical impact of FA-RP on patients based on a comparison of the clinical outcomes and medical records of the patient cohort enrolled during the period from October 2016 to March 2018 with the data of a cohort retrospectively collected for the period between October 2014 and March 2016. We aimed to evaluate the effect of using the FilmArray in terms of the quantification of antimicrobial use, use of antiviral drugs, and de-escalation or adjustment of antibiotic treatment.\\nOctober 2016 and March 2018, including two consecutive winter seasons. Eligible patients were recruited based on a modified definition of UP by CHUPSN as follows: (a) fever (>38°C); (b) pneumonia radiographic results; (c) normal or slightly decreased number of total white blood cells in the early stage of the disease; (d) duration of illness of ≤14 days; (e) poor response to initial antibiotic treatment; and (f) a minimum age of 18 years old. Samples from all enrolled patients were submitted to FA-RP analyses and were accordingly referred to as the \"FA-RP group.\" We recorded the demographic characteristics of patients and their relevant clinical data. Patients in the FA-RP group who were not lost to follow-up and had complete data were referred to as the \"intervention group.\" A historical control cohort was retrospectively recruited using the same inclusion criteria among patients who were hospitalized between October 2014 and March 2016, during which time the FA-RP was not available. Similar to the FA-RP group, relevant data of the patients within the control cohort were recorded.\\ntyped,\" we performed further real-time RT-PCR analysis for Influenza A/H7N9, H5N1, and H1N1-2009 subtyping. A nucleic acid extraction kit (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Qiagen) and real-time PCR kits (Influenza A/B, Influenza A/H1N1-2009, Avian Influenza A/ H7N9, and Avian Influenza A/H5N1 Viral RNA Detection Kits from Fluorescence PCR) were used in accordance with the respective manufacturers\\' instructions. For the detection of viral RNA, nucleic acids were extracted from 200-µL aliquots of each clinical specimen using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. Individual real-time PCR assays were performed in 25-µL volumes in a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using 5 µL of isolated nucleic acid; a universal master mix for RNA (One-Step RT-PCR master mix; Zhijiang Biology); universal amplification conditions consisting of one cycle for 10 minutes at 45°C and one cycle for 15 minutes at 95°C, followed by 45 two-step cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 60 seconds at 60°C; and TaqMan fluorogenic chemistry for detection. For all sets of primers and probes, no-template controls were included in each reaction plate. Specimens that reached the threshold before 35 cycles were considered positive.\\nA total of 112 eligible adult patients were prospectively included in the FA-RP group from October 2016 to March 2018, and samples from all patients were evaluated using the FA-RP. Among these, 50 patients (44.6%, 50/112) were hospitalized and for whom we had complete clinical data. The remaining 62 patients (55.4%) were lost to follow-up for outpatients or because of being transferred to other hospitals. As the control group, 70 eligible adult patients were retrospectively enrolled between October 2014 and March 2016 (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of both patient groups are shown in\\nAmong the 112 respiratory samples assessed using the FA-RP, 86 (76.8%) were positive and 26 (23.2%) were negative. The detected pathogens included Influenza A virus (n = 40, 35.7%), Influenza B (n = 13, 11.6%), M pneumoniae (n = 8, 7.1%), adenovirus (\\nAmong the patients in the FA-RP group, 53.8% (60/112) received antiviral treatment, including oseltamivir and acyclovir, compared with 12.7% (10/79) in the control group (P < .01). Adjustment of antibiotic therapy was recorded for 69.6% (78/112) of the patients in the FA-RP group, compared with 5.1% (4/79) in the control group (P < .01).\\nWhen specimens were positive for Influenza A viruses other than H1, H1-2009, and H3, FA-RP reported as \"not subtyped.\" c Extra microbiological investigations, including smear, culture, or serology, were done for negative specimens. Pneumocystis jiroveci (n = 1), Aspergillus spp. (n = 1), Mycoplasma pneumonia (n = 1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 1), mixed infection with Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida tropicalis (n = 1) were confirmed.of the FA-RP may be of particular benefit with respect to the clinical management of pneumonia of unknown cause.\\n< .001). Among those patients who received a positive test result for the Influenza virus, 100% (43/43) were treated with oseltamivir that is notably higher than the 74%-81% reported in other studies carried out in the United States. 15,16 Moreover, adjustment of antibiotic therapy was reported for 69.6% (78/112) of the patients in the FA-RP group, compared with only 5.1% (4/79) in the control group. These findings strongly indicate that the results of the FA-RP test may assist in clinical decision making, particularly with respect to reducing unnecessary antibiotic usage in the treatment of UP. The rapid identification of pathogens causing respiratory tract infection has both essential clinical and public health values. In the present study, 15 of the enrolled patients were promptly isolated as soon as the diagnosis of Influenza virus infection had been established. In contrast, for the control group patients who did not receive precise diagnosis of causing agents, no comparable isolation measures were undertaken. Such a lack of an accurate diagnosis may lead to a delay in patient isolation and, consequently, the wider spread of viruses. Moreover, for these patients, we consciously sought to regularly analyze the viral nucleic acids in the patient\\'s respiratory specimens using real-time PCR, and patients were discharged only after the nucleic acid test proved negative, thereby reducing the risk of the disease spreading. To further evaluate the clinical impact of the FA-RP, we compared the antibiotic use of adult UP patients in the FA-RP cohort and the historical control cohort, the latter of which were diagnosed only by using conventional methods. We found that compared with the control cohort, the intervention group had significantly lower antimicrobial DDDs, particularly with respect to the use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs. These results thus serve to highlight that given the benefit of an accurate diagnosis of the etiology, a more reasonable antibiotic usage could be achieved. These results are partially consistent with the findings of some previously published studies. For example, Rogers et al 17 evaluated the outcomes in pediatric patients (3 months to 21 years old) admitted to hospital with an acute respiratory illness, and, similar to the findings of the present study, found that the use of FA-RP facilitated a reduction in the duration of antibiotic use and the length of hospitalization. However, another\\nhas covered two consecutive pandemic seasons. More importantly, it describes the positive clinical impacts of the FA-RP, particularly in terms of antibiotic use. Similarly, Duan et al 24 examined the use of the FA-RP in the management of lower respiratory tract infections in a larger population in Beijing. A shorter length of hospitalization and a reduction in antibiotic use were observed. Other studies, however, tended to focus on the performance of the FA-RP or merely a description of the detected pathogens.\\n(14.1 ± 8.8 vs 13.1 ± 3.3, P < .05) for the intervention group. For\\nThe findings of the present study also confirmed that sputum and BALF could be used as samples for FA-RP tests, which contrasts with the manufacture\\'s assertion that NPS stored in viral transport media (VTM) is the only suitable material that is compatible. Indeed, we obtained positive FA-RP results for all the types of respiratory We prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with UP during the period from October 2016 to March 2018, and attempted to identify the causal pathogens. We accordingly found that Influenza A virus was most commonly reported causal agent, followed by It is worth noting that for the commercial FA-RP used in the present study, identification of Influenza A virus is limited to the H3, H1, and 2009-H1 subtypes, whereas for other subtypes, such as H7N9, the FA-RP can only provide the vague result of \"not subtyped\\nTA B L E 4 Comparison of antimicrobials\\' DDDs between FA-RP intervention group and control groupWe only calculated DDDs of the first 7 d after admission.\\n, that is, a more severe condition may lead to a prolonged hospital stay. More importantly, stricter criteria of discharge were required for the intervention group. According to regulations sanctioned by the Chinese Ministry of Public Health in 2009, discharge of Influenza A H1N1 patients demands both a recovery of condition and two consecutive negative test results of viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens. Therefore, intervention group patients positive for Influenza A took follow-up PCR tests. The patients could not be discharged from the hospital until they met the criteria. In contrast, for the control group, lacking precise diagnosis of causing agents, no such criteria were required. In our practice, application of FA-RP prolonged the length of stay; however, we believe additional benefits concerning public health and disease control were achieved.',\n",

       "       '. Of the 32 BALFs, the Flu A RRT-PCR detected 31 positives (96.9%) after Maxwell 16-S extraction and 29 positives (90.6%) after QIAamp extraction, and the only one missed after Maxwell 16-S extraction exhibited a weak positive reaction (Ct = 39.52) after QIAamp extraction.There was no statistical difference (P = 0.625) in the detection rates between the two methods. However, the Maxwell 16-S gave lower Ct values in 27/32 BALFs than the manual method, with the median Ct difference being -1.35 cycles (P,0.001) (Table 2). Furthermore, the Ct values of 31 mock-infected BALFs were delayed 0.76 cycles after Maxwell 16-S extraction and 1.74 cycles after QIAamp extraction, respectively, relative to the Ct values of controls containing the same amount of the virus (pH1N1SWL02).Analysis of fecal extracts by the Flu A RRT-PCR showed that the median Ct value differences between the Maxwell 16-S and QIAamp methods were -0.04 (P = 0.307) in poultry fecal pools and 1.40 (P = 0.234) in human fecal pools(Table 3). Their positive rates were 34/42 (81.0%) vs 39/42 (92.9%) in poultry fecal pools (P = 0.125), 12/18 (66.7%) vs 14/18 (77.8%) in human fecal pools (P = 0.688). There were no statistical differences in the Ct values and detection rates. Nevertheless, the Ct values of mock-infected poultry fecal samples (n = 32) and human fecal samples (n = 18) were increased by 1.55 and 4.72 cycles, respectively, for the Maxwell 16-S and 0.71 and 2.65 cycles, respectively, for the QIAamp method compared to those of viral controls. The results indicate that more RT-PCR inhibitors were co-extracted with viral RNA by Maxwell 16-S than by QIAamp Kit, which led to more false negatives. Of the 14 false-negative samples following Maxwell 16-S extraction, 9 turned positive after a 10-fold dilution of their extracts.

The first, white noise (light gray) contains 5000 random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution with µ = 0, sd = 1. The remaining three time series contain exactly the same random numbers as in the white noise time series, i.e. we do not resample, but every 10th value is set to either -100 (blue), 0 (black), or 100 (red).\\n2.) On the one hand, the use of permutation entropy for the quantification of predictability of time series is not a new idea. It was introduced by Banadt and Pompe in 2002 and since then there are numerous applications of this concept. On the other hand, the main findings are already known in the community: the forecasting capability is limited by the time horizon, the predictability depends on the heterogeneity of the network (see e.g. Hafnagel et al., 2003, PNAS, 101, 15124-15129).\\n6.)

The MFI was measured from a microsphere mixture containing 2500 microspheres of each of the three probe types, the Noro, Ino18 and InflA probes, after hybridization with 0.2 nM of the synthetic biotinylated target. Hybridization was performed at 45 C and 55 C, shown in SupplementaryFigure S1Aand B\\nContinued experiment contained triplet samples and was repeated two or three times. The Noro target, complementary to the Noro probe, was mutated gradually towards the InflA target sequence, resulting in twelve new targets and the InflA target (Figure 4A). The sequences of the panel of probes and targets are displayed inSupplementary Table 3Aand B. The system used to name the targets is based on matching and mismatching the nt in the target to those in the Norovirus probe, the Ino18 probe, and the InflA probe: (nt matching those of the Norovirus probe at 5 0 and 3 0 ) mismatching (mm) nt versus the Norovirus_Ino18_InflA probe (nt matching those of the InflA probe at 5 0 and 3 0 ).

       "       \",17 Production of hemolysis is inferior when the organism is grown on sheep's blood agar. The presence of colonies ofA haemolyticum should be suspected by recognition of a black opaque dot that can be observed if the colony is scraped away after 48 hours of growth) 5 To date, routine culturing for the presence ofA haern@ticum for patients with phar~aagitis is not recommended, and infected patients are ~ikely to be missed by standard throat culture techniques. The necessity of treating pharyngitis caused byA haemolyticure is unproven. However, antimicrobial therapy is said to be associated with a shortened duration of clinical illness, ms In vitro susceptibility tests have shown A haenu)~ttcum to be susceptible to penicillin and eLythromycin, as well as a number of other agents. Nonetheless, treatment of suspected cases of pharyngitis caused byA haemolyticum should be undertaken with erythromycin, as there have been reports of clinical failure and in vitro tolerance when penicillin has been used.18 Chlamydia and Mycoplasma Komaroff et al have suggested an etiological role for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasrna pneumoniae in cases of pharyngitis in adults) 9 Using serological evidence as the basis of diagnosis, these investigators reported that approximately 20% and 10% of 763 adults with phar~aagitis had a four-fold rise in antibodies against C trachomatis and M pneumoniae, respectively. However, subsequent studies have failed to confirm this observation. McMillan and colleagues performed a case-control study of the causes of phar}nagitis in school-age children (4 to 18 years). 2~ The etiological diagnosis was based on cultures performed forM pneumoniae, C trachomatis, and respiratocy viruses. The investigators did not recover a single positive culture for C trachomatis from any of 302 children with sore throat nor from any of 308 healthy controls. Similarly, Gerber et at. did not recover a single positive culture for C trachomatis from 95 college students with acute phansngitis. ~l Huovenin and colleagues also evaluated the role of Chlamydia and Mycoplasma in pharyngitis in adults by culture and serology. 22 Similar to the studies of McMillian and Reed, none of 106 patients was found to have evidence of C trachomatis. However, 9 patients had serological evidence of infection with Cpneumoniae, supporting the possibility that this agent may be a cause of pharyngitis.\\nInfectious Causes of Pharyngitis\",\n",

       "       'shows one of the comparisons of efficacy between favipiravir and oseltamivir in the influenza virus infection model established with a high titer of virus in a series of experiments, and the better efficacy of favipiravir compared with oseltamivir was observed in an animal with a severe lethal influenza infection with a high viral load\\nshows the influenza virus growth cycle and the sites of action of anti-influenza\\nsynthesized by viral RdRp with low fidelity from the RdRp-viral RNA complex. The anti-influenza drugs NAIs and baloxavir inhibit the spread of infection but allow the synthesis of genomic RNA, and the genomic RNA pool is important from the perspective of the generation of resistant viruses as a source of drug-resistant viruses.The spontaneous mutation rate of the influenza virus RdRp complex is approximately 1 x 10 4 . Titers of influenza virus in culture reach approximately 10 8 /mL in 5 per nucleotide in the genome. Therefore, all types of mutated genomes should be synthesized and present as genomic RNA, even in cells treated with anti-influenza drugs.\\nBaloxavir-resistant viruses emerged in 18 of 77 (23.4%) patients. Emergence was associated with a prolonged detection of the infectious virus (median time, 180.0 hours) and time to illness (median, 79.6 vs 42.8 hours in patients without PA/I38T/M-substituted viruses) (Hirotsu, et al., 2019). Baloxavir-resistant influenza viruses cause new human-to-human infections and have the ability to spread infections (Takashita, et al., 2019). Oseltamivir-and baloxavir-resistant mutants emerge and become dominant viruses during their treatment, and the resistant viruses are transmitted to other hosts. Thus, these resistant viruses may become dominant pandemic viruses. In contrast, favipiravir treatment does not change the susceptibility of 57 pairs of viruses to favipiravir before and after treatment\\ngenerate a drug-resistant virus, and render antiviral drugs ineffective during prolonged viral growth in patients treated with oseltamivir or baloxavir. Although drug-resistant viruses may have a reduced ability to grow, the use of drugs in many patients continues the selection pressure to ensure that resistant viruses become dominant. Drug selection continues, and the resistant strain becomes dominant during pandemics because drug-resistant strains are selected in many patients treated with the same anti-influenza drug. Regarding a resistant virus with good replication capability, oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses possessing the NA H275Y substitution spread globally during the 2008 to 2009 season. Thus, we have experience with a global pandemic of an oseltamivir-resistant strain. Favipiravir maintains the same efficacy from the first to the last patient of a pandemic because its resistant strain does not appear or does not replace the original strain.\\nAccording to the WHO (EuroWHO, 2019), \"Three influenza pandemics occurred at intervals of several decades during the 20th century, the most severe of which was the so-called \"Spanish Flu\" (caused by an A(H1N1) virus), estimated to have caused 20-50 million deaths in 1918-1919. Milder pandemics occurred subsequently in 1957-1958 (the \"Asian Flu\" caused by an A(H2N2) virus) and in 1968 (the \"Hong Kong Flu\" caused by an A(H3N2) virus), which were estimated to have caused 1-4 million deaths each. While most cases of pandemic H1N1 were mild, globally it is estimated that the 2009 pandemic caused between 100,000-400,000 deaths in the first year alone.\" Elderly individuals had immunity to pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09, and although people developed a milder form of influenza, it spread quickly throughout the world. Once an avian influenza outbreak occurs, more people are infected than in the pandemic of 2009, with similar or faster global spread. Predictions of\\nmay need a higher concentration in vivo. Pharmacokinetic values of favipiravir for the maximum drug concentration (Cmax), the area under the curve (AUC), the maximum drug concentration time (Tmax), and the half-life period (t1/2) are 65 μg/mL, 450-550 μg·hr/mL, 1 hour, and 4.8-5.6 hours, respectively (Avigan Tablets 200 mg package insert).\\nLegends\\nstructures of favipiravir and its related compounds.A. Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide). T-705 is the code number of favipiravir.B. Guanosine, inosine, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), ribavirin, and ribosyl favipiravir. Guanosine, inosine, and AICAR are biosynthesized in the body, and ribavirin and ribosyl favipiravir are synthesized nucleoside analogue s. They have similar chemical structures, but favipiravir and the other two compounds differ because they contain pyrazine, triazole, and imidazole that are marked by red circles.\\nof fever induction by influenza and antipyretic action of cinnamyl compounds and NSAIDs.\\nComparison of the efficacy of favipiravir and oseltamivir in lethal influenza virus infection.Mice were infected with 3 × 10 4 plaque forming units of influenza A/PR/8/34 virus and were orally administered favipiravir and oseltamivir at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days beginning at 1 h post-infection (n=14).

The authors obtained permission from the Antiviral Chemistry and Chemotherapy to reuse this figure(Takahashi et al., 2003).\\ncycle of influenza and sites of action of anti-influenza drugs.Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) binds to its receptor, sialic acid on the cell surface and is taken up into endosomes by endocytosis. Endosomes are gradually acidified to produce late endosomes, viral matrix-2 (M2) ion channels acidify viral particles, and the structure of trimeric HA molecules changes and shows membrane fusion activity. The endosomal membrane and envelope are then fused, and the genomic RNA and RdRp complex in the virus particle are released into the cytoplasm (uncoating) and transported to the nucleus through the cytoplasm. The transcription (replication) of genomic RNA by the RdRp complex occurs in the nucleus, and the genomic RNA is abundantly produced. Genomic RNA lacks the Cap structure required for mRNA function, and the Cap portion of the host mRNA is removed by a Cap-dependent endonuclease. Then, the Cap portion is coupled to genomic RNA, and viral mRNA synthesis is complete (Cap-snatching). Viral proteins are synthesized from the mRNA, and viral proteins and genomic RNA are transported to the cell surface and bud from the membrane to form viral particles. Since the budding virus is bound to the sialic acid on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infected cell surface via the HA protein of virus particles, it is unable to leave the infected cell and infect new cells. For this reason, the sialic acid-HA bond is cleaved by neuraminidase\\nTherapeutic activity of favipiravir in human RNA virus infections or in animal models of human RNA virus infections',\n",

       "       'Respiratory virus infection is associated with T-cell impairment. During respiratory virus infection, impaired virus-specific T cells in the lung fail to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines or perform cytotoxic functions. T-cell impairment is at least partially mediated by expression of inhibitory receptors, which decrease effector T-cell function and promote Treg activity. In contrast, virusspecific T cells in the spleen rarely express inhibitory receptors and are functional. PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors are expressed in the lung during both primary infection and reinfection.

This effect was most dramatic when the FG loop was in combination with the DE loop of HPV31, resulting in a median increase in cross-neutralising antibody recognition of 155.7-fold (IQR, 49.7 to 288.4-fold; p < 0.001) compared to the HPV35 PsV. The cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the chimeric L1L2 PsV was independent of the HPV vaccine received. For example, the replacement of the FG loop within the HPV31 L1 backbone with that of HPV35 resulted in a median 17.8-fold (IQR, 8.2 to 39.8-fold; p < 0.001) and 20.1-fold (IQR, 10.8 to 40.5-fold; p < 0.001) decrease relative to the HPV31 PsV for Cervarix ® and Gardasil ® sera, respectively.

       "       \"a ete postule que dans la biosphere primitive, il y a environ 4 milliards d'annees, la forme primaire du materiel genetique etait constituee par I'ARN [12, 171. Les proprietes d'autoreplication, d'autoclivage et d'autoligature de I'ARN ont alors permis de generer une immense diversite de combinaisons genetiques, aboutissant finalement a I'acquisition de la capacite de codage de proteines autorisant la formation de ribonucleoproteines. Levolution par echange de sequences d'ARN, recombinaison d'ARN et organisation progressive des genes, a abouti a une augmentation de la complexite genetique des genomes primitifs. Faisant suite a cette evolution primitive, I'ARN a probablement ete remplace par I'ADN chimiquement et genetiquement plus stable, permettant un accroissement de la taille des genomes et des degres de complexite genetique encore plus Pleves. Ainsi, alors que la biosphere actuelle est a base d'ADN, I'organisation en introns et exons des genomes cellulaires pourrait constituer I'empreinte de cette evolution. De meme, les retrotransposons, et les ARN autoreplicatifs ou replicons tels que les genomes des virus a ARN ou les viroi'des peuvent etre consider& comme des reminiscences de formes de vie plus primitives. La variabilite genetique resulte d'erreurs lors du processus de replication et d'alterations du materiel genetique. Alors que dans le cas de I'ADN I'existence de mecanismes de relecture et de reparation permet le maintien ou la restauration de I'integrite du materiel genetique, de tels mecanismes n'existent pas pour I'ARN, ce qui se traduit par I'accumulation de mutations et d'alterations du materiel genetique. Ainsi, I'avantage de I'ARN par rapport a I'ADN comme support de I'information genetique, reside dans son extreme plasticite et son adaptabilite aux variations environnementales. Cela est vrai non seulement pour les ribovirus mais egalement pour les retrovirus et les hepadnavirus qui utilisent de facon alternative I'ARN et I'ADN comme support de leur information genetique au tours de la replication de leur genome. Ces derniers, qui ne seront pas discutes en detail ici, tirent avantage a la fois de la plasticite et de I'adaptabilite du monde in base d'ARN et de I'integration stable et des capacites de recombinaison et de regulation offerts par le monde a base d'ADN.\\nLa variabilite et I'organisation genetique en quasi-especes des virus a ARN ont des implications importantes en termes de pathogen&e virale et de developpement de vaccins et d'agents antiviraux. Au sein d'une population de quasiespeces, des variants doues de proprietes biologiques particulieres peuvent emerger. Ceux-ci peuvent etre a I'origine d'echecs des strategies vaccinales ou de therapeutique antivirale, et peuvent occasionnellement avoir le potentiel d'induire des pathologies inconnues jusqu'alors ou une expression clinique nouvelle d'une pathologie connue.\\n. Ces proprietes, alliees a un taux de mutations et d'alterations du materiel genetique particulierement &eve sont a la base de I'extreme variabilite genetique des virus a ARN [lo]. 1. Mkanismes mokulaires de la variabiliti? ghhtique des virus h ARN Les mecanismes moleculaires qui sous-tendent la variabilite des virus a ARN sont les mutations, les recombinaisons homologue et non homologue, et le reassortiment pour les virus a ARN a genome segment&\\nTcrux de mutations des virus 2r ARN.

Parallelement a la recombinaison homologue qui peut se produire a la faveur d'une co-infection du meme hate par differents variants d'un meme virus, des Pvenements de recombinaison heterologue peuvent etre observes entre virus a ARN de la meme famille virale. Ainsi, le virus de I'encephalite equine de I'Ouest (WEE) serait le fruit d'une recombinaison entre les genomes du virus de I'encephalite equine de I'Est (EEE) et d'un virus Sindbis 1201, et des recombinants entre poliovirus et d'autres enterovirus ont ete mis en evidence [19]. Lexistence d'evenements de recombinaison entre virus de familles virales distinctes semble egalement se produire, comme cela est suggere notamment par la conservation du gene de I'hemagglutinine-esterase retrouve chez des virus d'au moins trois familles virales distinctes (Coronaviridue, Orfhomyxoviridae, Toroviridae)\\npeut se produire entre virus humains et virus d'origine animale comme pour les rotavirus ou les virus grippaux. Pour ces derniers, les evenements de reassortiment entre virus d'origine aviaire et humaine sont a I'origine des cassures antigeniques qui ont abouti a I'emergence de virus d'un sow-type nouveau responsables des grandes pandemies de grippe [48]. Toutefois, le processus de reassortiment apparait restreint aux virus appartenant au meme genre comme pour les Bunyuviridue, aux virus d'un meme type comme pour les virus grippaux, ou auxvirus d'un meme serogroupe comme pour les rotavirus. De plus, certaines constellations de segments genomiques ne sont pas ou peu representees, ce qui traduit vraisemblablement des incompatibilites, reflets de I'existence d'interactions entre certains genes ou produits de genes viraux. II est a noter que les mecanismes de reassortiment et de recombinaison strict0 sensu ne sont pas mutuellement exclusifs. En effet, des evenements de recombinaison intrageniques ont ete mis en evidence pour differents virus a ARN segmente comme les hantavirus [37] ou les rotavirus 1421, et, recemment, la possibilite qu'un evenement de recombinaison dans le gene de I'hemagglutinine entre un virus porcin et un virus humain puisse etre a I'origine du virus responsable de la pandemie de grippe espagnole de 1918 a ete evoquee [IS]. Du fait de la petite taille de leur g&tome, d'une frequence de mutation elevee, et d'une tolerance aux modifications genetiques, les virus a ARN meme clones ne forment pas une population homogene de virus dont les genomes ont une sequence identique, mais un ensemble complexe appele * quasi-espece n constitue de variants dont les genomes qui derivent les uns des autres different par une ou plusieurs mutations. Le concept de quasi-espece a initialement ete introduit par Eigen et al. 111, 121 afin de decrire les bases moleculaires de I'adaptabilite et de I'evolution des replicons primitifs lors des &apes precoces de la vie sur terre. Ce concept purement theorique s'applique bien pour decrire les variations et la dynamique des populations des virus a ARN d'aujourd'hui.\",\n",

At 8 h post electroporation, cells were pretreated with 1 mM HB (Invitrogen) in methionine-free media (Gibco, Life Technologies) for 20 min or left untreated. Next, ongoing protein synthesis was labelled with 1 mM AHA (Invitrogen) in methionine free media in the presence or absence of 1 mM HB for 40 min. Finally, cells were lysed in 1% SDS containing PBS supplemented with protein inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 250 U/ml bensonase (Sigma).

Transfected cells in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times (Fig. 4C, D, F). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual Luciferase Stop & Glo Reporter Assay System (Promega). Replicon activity was calculated as the ratio of Renilla (subgenomic reporter) to Firefly (cap-dependent translation, loading control), normalized by the same ratio for the wt O2RL replicon sequence. Three independent experiments each in triplicate were performed to confirm reproducibility of the results.\\nComparative genomic analysis of astroviruses.

Results were normalized to the amount of SINV RNA in the same sample. Fold differences in RNA concentration were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT method. For HAstV1 CP quantification, the electroporated cells were seeded on 96-well plates at different dilutions, and at 24 hpe fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS. CP was detected using Astrovirus 8E7 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by LI-COR visualization and quantification.

       "       \"A total of 154 pooled fecal samples collected in 2016 (n = 76) and 2017 (n = 78) were used for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) testing of Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolates. The pooled fecal sample was thoroughly mixed in the collection bag, then 1 g was aliquoted into a sterile bag for AMR testing at Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC, National Microbiology Laboratory, Guelph, ON, Canada) using the culturing and testing methods described in the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (Government of Canada, 2016). Outcomes of AMR testing were evaluated using upper (UL) and lower (LL) Sterne limits. Only isolates classified as intermediate resistance (I) or resistant (R) were used for further comparisons.\\nE. coli was successfully isolated from 22 samples of the 154 pooled 2016 and 2017 fecal samples for AMR testing (12 from 2016 and 10 from 2017), no Salmonella isolates were obtained. Seven E. coli isolates were found to have intermediate resistance or were resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobials (three from 2016 and four from 2014), with six of seven isolates found to be resistant to tetracycline (\\nanemia virus (M55918)(Figure 1e)(Chu et al., 2013;Phan et al., 2014;Sauvage et al., 2011). Segments of detected sequences had 100% identity to NS1, VP1, and VP2 proteins. The assembled sequences with highest similarity to chicken parvovi-rus ABU-P1 (GU214704, Parvoviridae) (parvovirus 2014-ON_consensus) was highly related to the genomes of chicken parvovirus ABU-P1 and turkey parvovirus 260 (GU214706), which clustered separately from turkey parvovirus 1,078 (GU214705) (Figure 1f) (Day & Zsak, 2010). Sequences with highest similarity to chickenassociated smacovirus strain RS/BR/2015/4 (KY086299, unclassified) encoded for capsid and replication-associated proteins with 100% and 95% identities to chicken-associated smacovirus strain RS/BR/2015/4 and human smacovirus (AJF23075). In phylogenetic analysis, smacovirus 2014-ON_consensus sequence clustered most closely with chicken-associated smacovirus strains RS/BR/2015/1-RS/BR/2015/4 (KY086298-KY086301), but were also closely related to bovine feces-associated smacovirus strain GP3_46075_ cow (KT86222) and human smacovirus 1 isolate Virginia/2/2012/ Chesapeake/J23 (KP233186) (Figure 1g).4 | D ISCUSS I ONThis study is a preliminary assessment of viral sequences in the fecal matter of healthy commercial mink on 40 Ontario farms, and the di-versity of bacteriophage and eukaryotic virus sequences was fairly consistent with previous research on the fecal virome of carnivorous species (Fehér et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2014; Phan et al., 2015; Smits\\nA total of 308,817,457 sequences (average 4,609,216/sample) were used for trimming and de novo assembly. After assembly, 345,127 contigs (>700 bp) were extracted for comparison to GenBank's viral database. Contigs with ≥100 bp (112,144) of detectable similarity to a reference genome were used for further analysis. Ninetyeight percent of reads ≥100 bp aligned to bacteriophage sequences (109,612 sequences). Phage sequences were compiled and analyzed based on bacterial host. The most prevalent sequences were identified to have Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus bacterial hosts, with the top three bacteriophage species from each group listed in Table 1. Escherichia and Enterococcus-associated bacteriophage sequences had the highest identities to GenBank reference sequences (84%-94%).\\nOf 2,532 nonphage sequences,49% (1,237)  aligned to vertebrate viruses. The most prevalent of the vertebrate viruses were from viral families Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, and Herpesviridae. Vertebrate viral sequences detected with the highest identity (>92%) to previously reported viruses include posavirus 3, mink bocavirus, chicken anemia virus, avian gyrovirus 2, avian adeno-associated virus strains DA-1 and ATCC VR-865, gyrovirus 4, gyrovirus GyV3 (Table 3).

Previous fecal virome studies in ferrets and felids have also found high numbers of viral sequences belonging to the families Parvoviridae, Anelloviridae, and Picornaviridae, but have also detected sequences from the families Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Hepeviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Coronaviridae\\n). Similarly, the identified avian-associated viral sequences (chicken anemia virus, parvovirus, smacovirus, and avian adeno-associated virus) were most likely the result of mink diet. Previous evidence from viral metagenomic studies and case reports in ferrets, felids, mink, and other wild carnivores have also hypothesized that the presence of avian viruses and swine viruses in fecal samples is due to the diet of the animals\\nsembly and the resulting consensus sequences were compared to closely related viruses. Most consensus sequences found to be closely related to the initial best BLASTn hit of the individual sequences, with the exception of HCBI8.215-like virus 2014-ON_ consensus and chapparvovirus 2014-ON_consensus. HCBI8.215like virus 2014-ON_consensus was found to be more closely related to torque teno virus strain TTV-HD14a. Chapparvovirus 2014-ON_consensus did not cluster with the initial best BLASTn hit, Desmodus rotundus parvovirus strain DRA25, or three other parvoviruses with similar not closely related to Eidolon helvum parvovirus 2 isolate Parvo_th_node176_9_9_893755, rat parvovirus 2 strain 9 or turkey parvovirus TP1-2012/HUN, indicating that it could be a novel mink parvovirus. Aside from mink bocavirus, the other prevalent vertebrate viruses identified in this study have been previously isolated in other species.

Depending on which frame is translated, nascent epitopes are labeled by fluorescent anti-FLAG antibody fragments (Cy3-Fab, green 'Y') or anti-SunTag single chain variable fragments (scFv-GFP, blue 'Y'). Following the repeat epitopes is exon 1 of the GNAS locus, in which the peripheral membrane proteins AlexX (689 aa) and XXLb1 (690 aa) were placed in the 0 and -1 frames, respectively. Preceding the multi-frame tag is a multi-frame element (MFE). In this study, the HIV-1 frameshift sequence was used as the MFE. To facilitate single-RNA tracking, a 24X MS2 stem-loop tag was also placed in the 3' UTR. This tag is labeled by MCP-HaloTag (with JF646-HaloTag ligand, red).

The intensity of nascent chain signals within non-frameshifting translation sites(marked by just anti-FLAG Fab, green triangles, 217 translation sites initially in 19 cells) and frameshifting sites (marked by anti-SunTag scFv, cyan circles, 32 translation sites initially) drops with time as ribosomes complete translation, i.e. run-off. (B) Same as A, but with a modified multi-frame reporter with extra HA epitopes (orange, HA multi-frame tag) upstream of the frameshift sequence.

Occasionally, they switch to a frameshifting state (~8%) that can last from tens of minutes to an hour or so.

No reuse allowed without permission.\\nAccumulation of mature AlexX and XXLb1 proteins from multi-frame tags Mature AlexX (upper) and XXLb1 (lower) membrane proteins accumulate in distinct punctae that coalesce to form elongated structures that undulate dynamically. These structures are enriched at the top and bottom of cells and around the edge of the cytoplasm (arrows), consistent with membrane localization. Movie S2 shows the dynamics of these structures. In the +FSS multi-frame reporter, mature AlexX comes from 0 frame canonical translation, while mature XXLb1 comes from -1 frameshifting translation. In the -FSS control reporter, only mature AlexX accumulates, indicating little to no frameshifting. The -FSS (+1 nt) column shows accumulation of XXLb1 when an extra nucleotide is inserted in the -FSS control reporter following the start codon. This extra nucleotide pushes XXLb1 into the 0 frame, demonstrating it can be expressed.\\nA cell with all possible types of translation sites A sample cell exhibiting all four possible translation sites (TS).

(B) Average images of detected spots (33 mature proteins and 35 translation sites) were fit to a Gaussian to determine their intensity ratio, shown in the bar graph on the right. This ratio provides a calibration factor to convert translation site intensites to the number of riboeoms. The error bar represents the propagated 90% confidence interval from the fit.\\nFrameshifting sites have brighter RNA signals (A-E) Average RNA signals for non-translating RNA (no TS), 0 only translation sites (0 TS), and -1 frameshifting translation sites (-1 TS). The number of RNA used to generate each average image is shown. The bar graphs below show the Gaussian fit intensity (normalized to non-translating RNA, i.e. 0 TS sites). Experiments were done using (A) the +FSS multi-frame tag, (B) the +FSS reverse tag, (C) the +FSS multi-frame tag imaged without anti-FLAG Fab, and (D) the -FSS control tag. Error bars represent the fitted 90%confidence interval. Aside from the -FSS control, frameshifting sites (-1 TS) have significantly brighter RNA signals compared to canonical translation sites (0 TS). Note the frameshifting observed in the -FSS control represents less than 1% of translating RNA and can be considered background frameshifting.\\nUpon oligo RNA co-transfection, stimulated frameshifting still occurs at bright RNA sites, even though the fraction of bright RNA sites remains unchanged (A) Average RNA signals from non-translating RNA (no TS), 0-frame only translation sites (0 TS), and frameshifting translation sites (-1 TS) when different concentrations of oligo All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\\nFits to linear portion of ribosomal run-offs provide elongation rate estimates The total intensity of detected non-frameshifting and frameshifting translation sites decays with time after addition (at t = 0 sec) of the translational initiation inhibitor harringtonine. Data is taken from Fig. 4A. If L2 is the length of the tagged portion of the open reading frame and L1 is the length of the non-tagged portion, then the linear (post-tag) portion of the decay begins from approximately L1/(L1+L2/2). This portion of the curve provides an estimate of the elongation rate during the part of the run-off where no new epitopes arebeing translated. Therefore, the run-off fit is independent of the frameshifting kinetics that occur upstream of the epitopes. Curves are normalized to their initial values.\\nFluroescence recovery after photobleach of frameshifting sites (A) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed at frameshifting translation sites (yellow circle marks the photobleach spot). The fluorescence recovery of the 0-frame signal within these sites was quantified as a function , with sample pre, post, and recovery frames shown above. (B) The average FRAP recovery time can be fit to estimate the elongation rate. This rate is similar to what was measured with harringtonine in Fig. S7.\\nRibosome run-off from the HA multi-frame tag Ribosome run-off curve showing Sun signal in HA&Sun sites from the experiment performed in Figure 4B.

As the ribosomes move along the repeat epitopes, the translated nascent chains appear as green (FLAG-tagged nascent chains), blue (Sun-tagged nascent chains), and cyan (HA-tagged nascent chains) dots that increase in size as more epitopes are translated. When the RNA is in the nonframeshifting state, the FSS is labeled 'FSS(OF)' in green; when the RNA is in the frameshifting state, the FSS is labeled 'FSS(-1F)' in blue. The simulated time is shown to the right of the reporter. A large ribosomal traffic jam is created when the RNA switches into the frameshifting state.\\n-FSS-MF-AlexX (i.e. the HA multi-frame tag), the spaghetti monster HA (smHA)(Viswanathan et al., 2015)  was flanked with NotI and PstI, and then inserted into the N-terminal region of FSS-MF-AlexX. For the control constructs, FSS was removed using KpnI and XbaI. To keep the same frame for MF and AlexX, the following sequencewas ligated between KpnI and XbaI to obtain MF-AlexX (i.e. the -FSS control tag): 5'-GGT ACC GGG AAT TTT CTT CAG AGC AGA CCA GAG CCA ACA GCC GCA CCG TTT CTA GA -3'. To shift the -1 frame into 0 frame for MF and AlexX, the following sequence was ligated between KpnI and XbaI to obtain MF-AlexX (the -FSS(+1nt) tag): 5'-CGG GAA TTT TCT TCA GAG CAG ACC AGA GCC AAC AGC CGC ACC GTT CT -3'. scFv-sfGFP was amplified from pHR-scFv-GCN4-sfGFP-GB1-dWPRE (Plasmid #60907, addgene) using primers: 5'-GCG CGC ATA TGA TGG GCC CCG ACA TC -3'; 5'-GCC GGA ATT CGC CGC CTT CGG TTA CCG TGA AGG T -3'. The amplified scFv-sfGFP was flanked with NdeI and EcoRI, and then inserted into a pET21 vector backbone for expression and purification from E.coli. For HA multi-frame tag experiments, the HA epitope encoded in the scFv-sfGFP plasmid (Plasmid #60907) from Addgene was removed by site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange Lightning (Agilent Technologies) per manufacturer's instruction using primers: 5'-CCT CCG CCT CCA CCA GCG TAA TCT GAA CTA GCG GTT CTG CCG CTG CTC ACG GTC ACC AGG GTG CCC -3'; 5'-GGG CAC CCT GGT GAC CGT GAG CAG CGG CAG AAC CGC TAG TTC AGA TTA CGC TGG TGG AGG CGG AGG -3'.All rights reserved.

Briefly, bacteria were lysed in a PBS-based buffer with a complete set of protease inhibitors (Roche). Binding to the Ni-NTA resin was done in the presence of 10 mM imidazole. The resin was washed with 20 and 50 mM imidazole in PBS. The protein was then eluted in 300 mM imidazole in PBS. The eluted his-tagged MCP was dialyzed in a HEPES-based buffer (10% glycerol, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.01 % NP-40 detergent, and 1 mM DTT), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80C. Cell culture, transfection, and bead-loading U-2 OS cells were grown using DMEM (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with: 10% (v/v) FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine and 1% (v/v) Penicillin-streptomycin. Before experiments, cells were plated on a 35 mm MatTek chamber (MatTek) and DNA was either transiently transfected with Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Scientific) per the manufacturer's instructions or transiently transfected via bead-loading. As described previously (Hayashi-Takanaka et al., 2011; Morisaki et al., 2016) , bead-loading involved the following six steps: First, 100 µg/ml of fluorescently labeled Fab, 250 µg/ml of purified (GCN4) scFv-All rights reserved.

Far red signals were detected with the 637 nm laser and the 731/137 nm emission filter (FF01-731/137/25, Semrock). Red and green signals were separated by the combination of the excitation lasers and the emission filters installed in a filter wheel (HS-625 HSFW TTL, Finger Lakes Instrumentation); namely, the 561 nm laser and 593/46 nm emission filter (FF01-593/46-25, Semrock) were used for Cy3 imaging, and the 488 nm laser and 510/42 nm emission filter (FF01-510/42-25, Semrock) were used for sfGFP or A488 imaging. Live cells were placed into a stage top incubator set to a temperature of 37°C and supplemented with 5% CO2 (Okolab) on a piezoelectric stage (PZU-2150, Applied Scientific Instrumentation). The focus was maintained using the CRISP Autofocus System (CRISP-890, Applied Scientific Instrumentation). The lasers, the cameras, the filter wheel, and the piezoelectric stage were synchronized via an Arduino Mega board (Arduino). Image acquisition was done with open source Micro-Manager software (Edelstein et al., 2014). Imaging size was set to 512 x 512 pixels 2 (66.6 x 66.6 µm 2 ), and exposure time was set to 53.64 msec.\\nWhen the ribosome reaches the frameshift site, , it pauses, and may shift from the 0 frame to the -1 frame.

Briefly, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA to prepare for the sequencing 173 library. Each library was subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Sequenced reads were 174 All rights reserved.

The median genome coverage and sequencing depth was 46.8% 179 (2.8%-100%) and 12.0× (1.0×-7870.1×), respectively (Figure 1A). These findings indicate a 180 high degree of variation in viral loads of nCoV infections. As shown in the phylogenetic trees, 181 2019-nCoV genome identified in our specimens were highly conserved with the Wuhan 182 strain and closest to SARS-CoV (Figure 1B). 183 With these genomic information, we aimed to identify target regions of 2019-nCoV by 184 searching for sequences that were i) within the Orf1ab, N or E genes of the viral genome; ii) 185 conserved among strains of the novel virus; iii) differentiable from other pathogenic 186 coronaviruses. By analyzing the genetic similarity among the 52 cases 2019-nCoV and other 187 pathogenic CoVs (Figure 1C), we identified two potential target sequences in Orf1ab and one 188 in the N gene (data not shown).\\n205 microbes including i) bacteria commonly found in respiratory infections: S. pneumonia, H. 206 influenza, M. pneumonia, C. pneumonia, B. pertusiss; ii) human Coronaviruses: HCoV-OC43, 207 HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E; iii) other viruses commonly found in respiratory 208 infections: Adenovirus Type-3, H. Influenza B (Victoria), H influenza A (H3N2), HPIV-1, 209 RSV-A; and iii) other bacteria: S. mitis, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. coli, E. facecaiis. None of 210 the above interference samples triggered a false positive reaction (Figure 2C). Altogether, 211 these analytical assessments suggest CRISPR-nCoV as a promising molecular assay for 212 2019-nCoV detection with great sensitivity and specificity.\\nCRISPR-nCoV in Clinical Specimens215 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\\nof the analytical assessment, we further evaluated the diagnostic 216 potential of CRIPSR-nCoV in clinical specimens. A total of 114 RNA samples from clinical 217 respiratory samples were included in the evaluation, which consisted of 61 suspected nCoV 218 cases (among which 52 confirmed and 9 ruled-out by mNGS), 17 nCoV-/hCoV+ cases and 219 36 samples from healthy subjects (Figure 3A). 220 When conducting the CRISPR-nCoV assay, a positive control (PC) DNA and a 221 no-template control (NC) were included in parallel for each run. Florescent signal from NC 222 was used to normalize the signal and generate corresponding fold-change values (FC). We 223 noticed that there were clear distinction in signal patterns of the reactions. Specifically, the 224 fluorescent signal curve either remained flat as a negative curve (e.g. the NC runs) or had a 225 distinguishable positive signal curve (e.g. the PC runs). The negative curves yielded a 226 maximal FC value of 1.4, whereas the positive ones had a minimal FC value of 5.0. A cut-off 227 was set 3.0 which was set for a complete separation (Figure S1). Consistently, this cut-off 228 offered the optimal sensitivity and specificity as confirmed by an ROC analysis (data not 229 shown).\\n230 CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% by detecting all 52 231 2019-nCoV-positive cases. No false positives were found in all 62 negative cases, including 232 all the hCoV-infected ones (Figure 3B), suggesting promising clinical sensitivity and 233 specificity of CRISPR-nCoV.\\nset out to compare the diagnostic performances among mNGS, RT-PCR and 237 CRISPR. Using mNGS as the reference, PCR-and CRISPR-nCoV both had a specificity of 238 100% in our study. PCR-nCoV was able to detect the virus in 90.4% (47/52) of the positive 239 cases, with Ct's ranging from 28.8 to 40.4 and a median Ct of 35.8. It worth noting that the 5 240 false negative samples by PCR-nCoV had a median mNGS read number of 550, which is 241 much lower than that of the other positive samples at 2,381 reads, suggesting a lower titer of 242 the virus in these samples. CRISPR showed a greater sensitivity by detecting all 52 243 nCoV-confirmed cases (100%), with FC values ranging from 5.0 to 66.3 and a median FC of 244 22.8 (Figure 4A). 245 When the reaction turn-around time (TAT) is compared, the CRISPR-nCoV reaction 246 requires only 40 minutes, which is the least among the three and includes 30 minutes of DNA 247 amplification and 10 minutes of Cas reaction. PCR-nCoV requires about 1.5 hours for a 248 completion run of the PCR program. mNGS takes approximately 20 hours, which includes 8 249 hours of library preparation, 10 hours of sequencing and 2 hours of bioinformatic analysis. 250 Because a positive result may be determined before completing the PCR program, we 251 calculated the effective TAT as the time when the florescent signal reached the threshold. As 252 showed in Figure 4B, CRISPR-nCoV presented a significant advantage in effective TAT over 253 PCR and mNGS. 254 Altogether, we demonstrated a CRISPR-based assay for 2019-nCoV that offered shorter 255 turn-around time and great diagnostic value, even in under-resourced settings without the 256 need of thermal cyclers. Our study also emphasized strength and weakness of different 257 All rights reserved.

An RT-PCR assay 272 for 2019-nCoV is faster and more affordable. Nevertheless, the need for a thermo cycler by 273 PCR-based diagnostics hinders its use in low-resource settings and curbs the assay 274 throughput. Besides their lower demand for sophisticated temperature controlling instruments, 275isothermal molecular methods are advantageous owing to its faster nucleic acid amplification.\\nHowever, there have been debates over the specificity of such methods.

Cautions should be taken 283 that certain unknown genomic variations may produce critical impact on the assay efficiency. 284 For example, a mutation or polymorphic site that abrupt the binding of the very 3' end of a 285 PCR primer may cause a drastic reduction in sensitivity. Although not without its own 286 shortcomings on TAT and costs, NGS-based assays demonstrated a great level of sensitivity 287 and should still be used for continuous monitoring of genetic drifts in the viral genome. These 288 information will provide valuable insights not only from a public health standpoint, but also 289 to guide necessary optimization of targeted assay development.\\n(A) Number of mNGS reads mapped to the genome of 2019-nCoV in 52 positive 343 cases; (B) Phylogenetic tree of 2019-nCoVs and other pathogenic CoVs; (C) 2019-nCoV 344 gene structure and CRISPR target region.

A. \"Prosthetic\" cell implants to control glucose levels by blue light in a mouse model of human type-2 diabetes [32]. Implants contain encapsulated human cells (yellow ovals) with an assembled signal transduction pathway that couples light detection by melanopsin (a blue-light receptor from the retina) via calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling to activation of a transcriptional gene activator, the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). NFAT in turn activates expression of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), a type-2 diabetes drug candidate, from a gene construct controlled by NFAT DNA-binding elements. B. Generation of live attenuated influenza virus vaccines by synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) [16] (adapted/reprinted with the permission of Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Biotechnology, Mueller et al., Nat Biotechnol 28, 723-726, copyright 2010). Hundreds of nucleotide changes were introduced into three genes of the influenza virus (NP, PB1, and HA; see top panel) by computer-aided rational design and gene synthesis. While preserving the amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins, these changes rearrange existing synonymous codon pairs and reduce protein synthesis. A synthetic virus containing the three deoptimized genes (PR8 3F ) can be safely used to immunize mice: they survived vaccine administration with this attenuated virus, except in the case of very high doses (bottom panel, at left); and safe vaccine doses led to immune protection following a lethal dose of the wild-type virus (bottom panel, at right).

The array consists of multiple E. coli colonies (\"biopixels\"; schematically represented by single cells, black rounded rectangles) growing in wells of a microfluidic device (light blue), through which media can be pumped (top). Cells contain an oscillator module based on genetic quorum-sensing circuits (light green), producing synchronized oscillations of the expression of H 2 O 2 and of green fluorescent protein (GFP). H 2 O 2 can migrate between colonies and synchronize them by affecting the oscillator module. This genetic oscillator was coupled to one of two arsenite sensor modules (1 or 2) containing parts of the oscillator (luxR or luxl genes) under the control of an arsenite-responsive repressor protein (ArsR) and its cognate promoter element (yellow box). Oscillation can thus either be switched on/off (thresholding, 1) or modulated in frequency (period modulation, 2) by arsenite and measured via GFP fluorescence (panels on the right). B. Generation of synthetic riboswitches to generate bacteria that detect, follow and can destroy the herbicide atrazine [53]. A library of atrazine-binding small RNAs (aptamers) selected in vitro was inserted into the 5´-untranslated region of the cheZ gene that controls E. coli motility, upstream of a randomized sequence (NNN, upper panel). Together with an aptamer, the randomized sequence can become part of a riboswitch element that couples ligand binding and translational control of cheZ mRNA. By functional screening, riboswitches were selected that mediated atrazinedependent cell motility (bottom panel). When an atrazine-degrading enzyme is introduced, the cells migrate towards atrazine and degrade it. C.

Zhou et al. stability of the oxime linkage and hydrazide linkage for oligosaccharides up to pH 9. However, reactions of aminooxy or hydrazide groups with free carbohydrates are slow when the carbohydrate MW increases because of the reducing activity of the aldehyde group of the carbohydrates. To improve the immobilization of larger carbohydrates, such as polysaccharides, on the aminooxy-and hydrazidefunctionalized slide substrates, Zhou et al. have been investigating the utilization of microwave radiation energy to facilitate the fabrication of carbohydrate microarrays on a 3D polymer film bearing aminooxy-and hydrazide-functional groups (Zhou X., personal communication). Using microwave radiation to facilitate the reaction, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides can be covalently linked on the aminooxy-and hydrazide-functionalized surface within minutes.\\nQuantitative inhibition assays in oligosaccharide microarray.
