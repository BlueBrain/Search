Latest
======


Version 0.2.0
==============
**July 1, 2021**

- |Add| metrics file resulting from :code:`dvc` pipelines to :code:`git`.
  This allow now to use :code:`dvc metrics diff`.
- |Change| dependencies required to run the code of :code:`data_and_models/` are not
  installed by default and now require :code:`pip install .[data_and_models]`.
- |Add| in :code:`dvc`, in :code:`ner` pipelines, scripts allowing to train and evaluate
  NER thanks to the :code:`huggingface/transformers` package.
  A comparison with :code:`spaCy` training is also possible.
- |Change| reports format of Search Widget from PDF to HTML.
- |Remove| :code:`tqdm`, :code:`joblib`, :code:`pdfkit` dependencies.
- |Remove| :code:`bluesearch.mining.eval.plot_ner_confusion_matrix` function to drop
  :code:`joblib` from :code:`install_requires`.
- |Change| :code:`requirements.txt` refactored into three separate lists of
  dependencies: :code:`requirements.txt`, :code:`requirements-dev.txt`,
  :code:`requirements-data_and_models.txt`.
- |Fix| bugs (related to nested entities) in :code:`ner_report`, :code:`ner_errors`,
  :code:`ner_confusion_matrix` functions from :code:`bluesearch.mining.eval` submodule.
- |Add| utility function :code:`_check_consistent_iob` inside
  :code:`bluesearch.mining.eval`.
- |Change| upgrade linting tools in ``tox.ini``
- |Change| for Transformer-based :code:`spaCy` pipelines for NER models
  instead of Tok2Vec-based :code:`scispaCy` pipelines.
- |Change| for one entity per model instead of several entities per NER model.
- |Change| :code:`pipelines/ner/dvc.yaml` to simplify and harmonize the
  definition of the pipeline for training NER models.
- |Add| :code:`annotations/ner/analyze.py`, a code to evaluate the data quality
  of annotations. It could generate: 1) a detailed report for individual files
  when used as a script and 2) a summary table for several files when used as
  a function.
- |Add| :code:`pipelines/ner/clean.py`, a script to clean annotations. It keeps
  only valid texts, normalizes labels, keeps only a given label, and then
  renames the label if necessary.
- |Remove| :code:`ee_models_library.csv` and change the logic for one model per entity type.


Version 0.1.2
=============
- |Change| spaCy version from 2.x to 3.x, including scispaCy and models versions.
- |Change| the training of NER models: use spaCy directly instead of Prodigy,
  use the default configuration from spaCy 3 instead of from Prodigy, use the
  binary format (:code:`.spacy`) from spaCy 3 instead of the :code:`.jsonl`
  format from Prodigy.
- |Remove| Prodigy dependency.


Version 0.1.1
=============
- |Change| Upgrade to :code:`dvc 2.0`.
- |Remove| NLTK dependencies.
- |Change| Drop the dedicated :code:`SBioBERT` class, we now use
  :code:`SentTransformer` interface to support this model.


Version 0.1.0
=============
- |Add| in :code:`dvc` pipelines, the :code:`Dockerfile` now installs
  `requirements.txt` to fix the versions of dependencies. 
- |Add| support for :code:`Python 3.9`.
- |Add| Blue Brain Search as a Zenodo record. This provides a unique DOI, a DOI
  for each published release, and automatic preservation outside GitHub.
- |Add| the content of the DVC remote for Blue Brain Search v0.1.0 as a Zenodo
  record. This provides DOIs as for the code of Blue Brain Search above. This
  is also the first public release of the data and models of Blue Brain Search.
- |Remove| support for :code:`Python 3.6`.
- |Remove| the external dependency :code:`sent2vec` and the embedding models
  depending on it, i.e. :code:`BSV` and :code:`Sent2VecModel`.
- |Remove| the embedding model :code:`Universal Sentence Encoder`: (USE) and its
  dependencies (:code:`tensorflow` and :code:`tensorflow-hub`).
- |Remove| :code:`BBS_BBG_poc` notebook (now hosted on
  https://github.com/BlueBrain/Search-Graph-Examples) and :code:`assets/`
  directory.

==============

Changes
-------
- |Change| :code:`bluesearch` is the new name of the Python package, replacing the former :code:`bbsearch`.
