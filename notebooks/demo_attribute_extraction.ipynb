The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resultant residue was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography (Merck, 113895) (methanol/chloroform, 1:10) to give 20 (181 mg, 34% from 38) as a colorless oil.\",\n",
    "    \"The first generation of selective inhibitors for ACE2 have been designed and synthesised (table 1) [15, 16] . A series of non-peptide compounds were constructed based upon the ACE2 substrate consensus P-X(1-3)-P 1 -fl-X hydrophobic and the requirement of a centrally located carboxylate to co-ordinate with the zinc ion [15] . This lead resulted in the synthesis of an inhibitor (MLN-4760, table 1) possessing sub-nanomolar affinity (IC 50 , 50% inhibitor concentration 0.44 nM) for ACE2 and 220,000-and 22,000fold less affinity for human tACE and bovine carboxypeptidase A, respectively [15] .\",\n",

Four mice per group were humanly euthanized and lung, spleen, and brain tissues were sterilely collected at one hour and three weeks post exposure and CFUs were determined as previously described.\",\n",
