    Parameters
    ----------
    texts : iterable
        The elements in `texts` are tuples where the first element is the text
        to be processed and the second element is a dictionary with arbitrary
        metadata for the text. Each key in this dictionary will be used to
        construct a new column in the output data frame and the values will
        appear in the corresponding rows.

        Note that if `debug=False` then the output data frame will have
        exactly the columns specified by `SPECS`. That means that some
        columns produced by the entries in metadata might be dropped, and
        some empty columns might be added.
    model_entities : spacy.lang.en.English
        Spacy model. Note that this model defines entity types.
    models_relations : dict
        The keys are pairs (two element tuples) of entity types
        (i.e. ('GGP', 'CHEBI')). The first entity type is the subject
        and the second one is the object. Note that the entity types
        should correspond to those inside of `model_entities`. The value
        is a list of instances of relation extraction models, that is
        instances of some subclass of ``REModel``.
    debug : bool
        If True, columns are not necessarily matching the specification.
        However, they contain debugging information. If False, then
        matching exactly the specification.
    excluded_entity_type : str or None
        If a str, then all entities with type `not_entity_label` will be
        excluded. If None, then no exclusion will be taking place.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        The final table. If `debug=True` then it contains all the metadata.
        If False then it only contains columns in the official specification.
