A later confirmed pathogen of this previously unknown pneumonia was described as a novel coronavirus, currently named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2; previously known as 2019nCoV), was ascertained by unbiased sequencing analysis of lower respiratory tract samples from early cases on 7 Jan 2020, following which the protocol of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for this novel coronavirus had also been developed [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In fact, the epidemics of the two other novel coronaviruses, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have posed a huge threat to public health in the past two decades [8, 9] . SARS-Cov-2 in this outbreak, like the previous two viruses, is also categorized within the same genus of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae, but shows a strong affinity for human respiratory receptors [10, 11] .",

In particular, a recent study in Zhejiang province, China indicated that the symptoms of patients outside of Wuhan perhaps are relatively mild versus symptoms of initial cases in Wuhan [10] . Meanwhile, a new finding from a national wide descriptive report drew a huge amount of attention, which declared that the total number of confirmed novel coronavirus-infected medical staff was as high 1,716 as of 11 February 2020, with a peak incidence occurring on 28 January 2020 [12] . Hospital-related transmission are one of the causes for infection of health-care workers [21] , especially in the early stages of COVID-19 epidemic when there was a lack of knowledge about transmission approaches of SARS-CoV-2, as well as in the period when facing a shortage of protective materials. Nonetheless, the predominant cause of the infection and the failure of protection among health workers remains to be investigated [12] .",

Counts and percentages were utilized to describe categorical variables. Given the cut-off point at 10th day of symptoms onset proposed by previous studies [1, 21] , we assigned the patients into either one of two groups based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (\u226410 days) and group 2 (>10 days). We applied a Kaplan-Meier plot to inspect the change of hospital discharge rate. The proportional hazard Cox regression model was utilized to ascertain factors associated with hospital discharge. Univariate models with a single variable once at a time were first fitted. The statistically significant risk factors as well as age and sex were, then, included into a final multivariate Cox regression model.",
