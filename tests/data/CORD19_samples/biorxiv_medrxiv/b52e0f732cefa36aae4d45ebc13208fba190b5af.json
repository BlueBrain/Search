Later, MGTV was also named as Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), Kindia tick virus (KDTV), Guangxi tick virus (GXTV) etc. In the present study, we used small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to detect viruses in ticks and detected MGTV in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks, which had been captured in Yunnan province of China in the year of 2016. The fulllength genome sequence of a new MGTV strain Yunnan2016 (GenBank: MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100) was obtained and recommended to be included into the NCBI RefSeq database for the future studies of MGTV. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that viruses named MGTV, JMTV, KDTV and GXTV are monophyletic: the MGTV group (lineage) of viruses. We show, for the first time, that",

Compared to other NGS based methods that require viral enrichment and concentration, the small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) methods simplify virus detection and indeed have several other advantages [1] . The sRNA-seq based method was originally used for viral detection and identification in plants [2] and in invertebrates [3] . Although the sRNA-seq based method does not perform as well in the detection of mammalian viruses as in the detection of plant or invertebrate viruses, we still detected eight mammalian viruses: HPV-18 (Human Papillomavirus type 18) [4] , HBV (Hepatitis B Virus) [4] , HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) [4] , HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1) [4] , SMRV (Squirrel Monkey Retrovirus) [4] , EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus) [4] , SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) [5] and a DNA segment of ASFV (African Swine Fever Virus) [6] . The discovery of featured RNA fragments, including siRNA duplexes [7] , 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end small RNAs (5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs) [8] [9] , palindromic small RNAs (psRNAs) and complemented palindromic small RNAs (cpsRNAs) [5] , has increased our capacity to detect viruses in mammals. Moreover, we found that 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs can be used to annotate nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes at 1 bp resolution [10] [11] . Then, we found that 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs can be used to obtain the full-length 5' and 3' ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses at 1-bp resolution.",

With the development of NGS, a number of studies have used metagenomics to search for tick-associated pathogens [13] . However, the metagenomics methods using DNA can not be applied to detect RNA viruses without DNA stages. So the transcriptomics approaches using total RNA were also applied to detect tick viruses [14] . The sRNA-seq based method has been successfully used in the detection of Rickettsia in ticks [15] . As far as we know, there had not been previous reports of virus detection in ticks using the sRNA-seq based method until the detection of the DNA segment of ASFV [6] . Although very high-depth sRNA-seq data was used to detect a DNA segment of ASFV, the coverage of the ASFV reference genome was still very low. This suggested that the sRNA-seq based method does not perform as well in the detection of DNA viruses as in the detection of RNA viruses.",

RNA1, RNA2, RNA3 and RNA4 of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016 have been submitted to the NCBI GenBank database under the project accession numbers MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100, respectively. The software Fastq_clean [22] was used for sRNA data cleaning and quality control. The virus detection was performed using the pipeline VirusDetect [23] . For each detected virus, VirusDetect assigned a closest reference genome from the NCBI Genbank database to help characterize that virus. VirusDetect used reference genome coverage and average depth to quantify the detected viruses for verification. Genome coverage was defined as the proportion of read-covered positions divided by genome length whereas average depth was the total number of base pairs of aligned reads divided by the read-covered positions of the reference genome. Statistical computation and plotting were performed using the software R v2. 15.3 with the Bioconductor packages [24] .",

Using VirusDetect (Methods), MGTV was detected in A. testudinarium ticks (SRA: SRP084097), but not in D.nuttalli, D. niveus nor D. silvarum (SRA: SRP178347) that were used as negative controls. Since the A. testudinarium ticks were captured in Yunnan province of China in the year of 2016, the new MGTV strain was named the Yunnan2016 strain of MGTV. As a segmented RNA virus, MGTV comprises four RNAs in its genome, two of which (RNA1 and RNA3) are related to the nonstructural protein genes of the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), whereas the other two segments (RNA2 and RNA4) are unique to MGTV. VirusDetect (Methods) uses the closest reference sequence to report the detected virus. The reference genome of the MGTV strain Xinjiang2016 (GenBank: MK174251, MK174244, MK174230 and MK174237) was sequenced from wild rodents captured in Xinjiang province of China. The sRNA-seq data of A. testudinarium (SRA: SRR4116826) covered 86.71% of the Xinjiang2016 genome with an average depth of 46.66 (Table 1). The sample of A. testudinarium had much more sRNA-seq data aligned to the Xinjiang2016 genome (Figure 1B) or the Yunnan2016 genome (Figure 1A) than the samples of three other species (Figure 1C). RNA1, RNA3, RNA3 and RNA4 of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016 were assembled into contigs. PCR amplification coupled with Sanger sequencing (Methods) was used to fill the gaps between contigs and confirm the genome assembly. 93.7 % (2879/3073) of RNA1, 90.6 % (2528/2790) of RNA2, 88.3 % (2468/2795) of RNA3 and 95.2% (2619/2752) of RNA4 were confirmed by Sanger sequences [the polyA tails of 3'-UTRs were not part of these calculations].",

The 3' ends of all RNAs in the Yunnan2016 genome have an AC-enriched region (Figure 2B).

The length of the polyA tail in each 3'-UTR of these RNAs was set as 20 bp. The sRNA-seq data of A. testudinarium (SRA: SRR039620) covered 97.37% of the full-length genome sequence of Yunnan2016 with an average depth of 91.11 (Table 1). 58.5% (26668/45563) of the virus reads were aligned to RNA4 (Figure 1B).

The putative protein encoded by RNA3 is unknown. In total, five protein-coding genes were annotated for the genome of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase from RNA1, the putative protein from RNA3 and the capsid protein from RNA4 had lengths of 915, 809 and 255 aa, respectively. The lengths of these three proteins were the same in all 17 MGTV genomes whereas those of the other two proteins (the glycoprotein from RNA2 and the membrane protein from RNA4) differed with the other MGTV genomes. The lengths of the glycoprotein from RNA2 varied due to two mutations (Figure 2C).: T/C mutations in the start codons shortened the Coding Sequences (CDSs) of RNA2 by 21 bp whereas a small Insertions/Deletions (InDels) shortened the CDSs by 3 bp. Theoretically, four types of glycoproteins, with lengths of 745, 746, 754 or 755 aa, would be translated from RNA2, however, a glycoprotein with 746 aa was not observed in the 17 virus genomes. Since the lengths of the membrane protein from RNA4 varied due to one mutation T/C (Figure 2D), two types of membrane proteins with lengths of 522 or 539 aa can be translated from RNA4. RNA1, RNA3 and RNA4 had 2745-, 2427-and 2351-bp complete CDS 1, 3, and 4, whereas RNA2 had a 2265-bp complete CDS 2, with a 15-or 18-bp variable region removed (Figure 2C).
