We conducted an investigation to verify the existence of an outbreak and to identify the disease nature, mode of transmission and risk factors. Methods: We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis between 1 June 2015 and 15 October 2015 in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or neighbouring districts. We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed casepatients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (\u00b1 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. Results: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness. In the case-control study, 42% (5/12) of cases vs. 0.0% (0/77) of controls had liver disease (ORM-H = \u221e; 95%CI = 3.7-\u221e); 71% (10/14) of cases vs. 35% (28/81) of controls had ulcer disease (ORM-H = 13; 95% CI = 1.6-98); 27%",

We also interviewed village health team members, healthcare workers and case patients who sought care at the health facilities. We analyzed the case-patients' line-list data to elucidate the distribution of case-persons by person, place and time. Based on the results of the descriptive epidemiology, we formulated hypotheses about potential exposures. In the assessment of alcohol use as a potential exposure, we asked patients about the nature of alcohol they usually consumed and the average amount in one sitting. The alcohol consumed was quantified as number of standard drinks whereby one standard drink was equivalent to 285ml of beer or 30ml of distilled [8] . People who took more than 6 standard drinks were categorised as exposed. We conducted a case-control study to test alcohol intake as a possible risk factor for hematemesis among other hypotheses. In the case-control study, a case was defined as onset of hematemesis in a person during July to October 2015. A control-person was an individual without any history of hematemesis. Control-persons were matched to cases according to sex, age (\u00b1 10 years) and village of residence, with a case-tocontrol ratio of 1:4. Laboratory, also based at UVRI. These laboratories are national reference centres for viral and bacteriological diagnostics.

            "text": "Our investigation of the reported hematemesis outbreak ruled out a true outbreak. The surge in case count was likely to have been due to increased awareness and active case finding in the community after the initial cluster of cases were reported. Specifically, laboratory investigations did not point to VHF as the cause of this outbreak, as was initially suspected. Our data suggested that this illness cluster might have been caused by a combination of predisposing conditions (including liver disease, schistosomiasis and ulcer) and the misuse of NSAIDs (such as indomethacin and ibuprofen) that are known to trigger bleeding in patients with a bleeding tendency. In reviewing detailed clinical information of 31 patients with a post-mortem diagnosis of peptic ulcers, Felix and Stahlgren found that hematemesis was the initial symptom for 35% (11/31) of the patients; autopsy showed that 58% (18/31) of the Page number not for citation purposes 4 patients had an ulcer located in the duodenum and 12 patients had an ulcer in the stomach and 10 of those patients had a bleeding ulcer [11] . In another report of 52 cases that had bleeding gastric and duodenal ulcers over 9\u00bd years, 6 of the cases resulted in deaths; all 6 deceased persons were between the ages of 35 and 60 years and 4 had a history of hematemesis [12] . Similarly, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is known to increase the risk for upper gastro-intestinal bleeding [13] . Pathophysiologically, NSAIDs block the synthesis of prostaglandins, which promote the production of mucus that protects the lining of the gut from ulceration [14] , [16] . The enlarged abdomen could be a result of splenomegaly from chronic infection with Mansoni S. One study revealed that even a low community prevalence of infection with Mansoni S. can influence hepatosplenic morbidity [17] . In a case series in Brazil, hematemesis frequently occurred in patients with schistosomal splenomegaly [18] . Drug administration of praziquantel either singly [19] or in combination [20] should be implemented to treat any existing schistosomal infections. Also, because infection with the parasites is a result of contact with contaminated water, the sanitation should be improved in this community. The improvement of sanitation have been shown to reduce schistosomiasis related morbidity by as much as 77% [21] . This investigation was initiated because the symptoms of initial patients were suggestive of VHFs [3] . Although VHFs were eventually ruled out, the investigation and response served as a \"live fire exercise\" for the surveillance and response capacity of the Ministry of Health. In this age when the global public health system is constantly challenged by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases as well as new cycles of pandemics and threats of bioterrorism [22] , such a \"live fire exercise\" helps to continuously improve the emergency response system. Without a timely and effective response, public health emergencies of international concern could quickly spiral out of control, as were exemplified by the Ebola epidemic in West Africa [23] and SARS pandemic in China [24] . Conversely, rapid response and control in Uganda and Nigeria were shown to effectively contain these emergencies and prevent them from becoming a public health crisis [25, 26] .",

Alcohol intake of more than 6 standard drinks has been shown to be a significant predictor of future liver disease [30] . The high levels of alcohol use could explain the high prevalence of liver disease in this population, which is a major risk factor for hematemesis [31] . Epidemiological investigations have also revealed that among persons who use NSAIDS, the risk of acute upper gastro intestinal bleeding increases with the level of alcohol consumed [32] . Pharmacies in the area should warn their clients on the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when NSAIDS are taken with alcohol. In Uganda, many prescription and non-prescription medicines are sold by both licensed and unlicensed drug shops. Although there is legislation that specifies which medicines could be sold as non-prescription drugs, a wide gap still exists between policy and implementation [33] . This combination of a society with high levels of alcohol use and wide availability of over-the-counter medicines increases the risk of complications that arise from use of drugs such as NSAIDs, especially among persons with pre-existing conditions such as ulcers, schistosomiasis, liver disease and tuberculosis. People in rural communities in Uganda have been shown to have low access to health care [34] , low satisfaction with and poor perceived accessibility of the health care services [35] . Because of poor access to healthcare, it is possible that persons in our investigation were forced to self-medicate on drugs such as NSAIDs, which elevated their risk of developing hematemesis. Targeted interventions that address the widespread alcohol use, increase access to health care and health education on the dangers of NSAID use should be carried out for persons in this community and fisher folk in general.",

The hematemesis illness appeared to be endemic in this community and is likely to have been due to predisposing conditions (such as liver disease, schistosomiasis and ulcer), combined with the use of NSAID. We recommend that health education be conducted on the danger of misuse of NSAIDs, especially in persons with predisposing conditions. Limitations: in our investigation, the diagnoses of ulcer, tuberculosis, liver disease and other conditions were based on self-reports, which could cause bias. Also, for patients who had died before our investigation, we relied on proxy interviews of their family members and friends, potentially resulting in information bias. \uf0b7 Swift and prompt investigation into conditions that present with hematemesis can be an effective way of preventing the spiralling of public health emergencies of international concern as was evidenced in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

On 17 September 2015 the Ministry of Health of Uganda received a report from Buliisa District Health Office in western Uganda about a cluster of a mysterious fatal disease in Butiaba Sub-county. The dominant symptom was hematemesis while some patients had fever. By 24 September 2015, there had been 4 deaths. Since outbreaks of VHFs have occurred in nearby districts in the past",

The epidemic curve shows that approximately 3 cases occurred every week from June 2015 to September 2015 (Figure 1). The peak occurred in the middle of September after the Ministry of Health started community mobilization and active case-finding. The data from the review of records in both Hoima and Buliisa Districts showed an average of about 8 cases recorded for every month (Figure 2). For both years 2014 and 2015, the month of August had the highest number of cases. More cases occurred in August and September 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. Overall, we observed no consistent patterns in the trends of the case counts in the affected districts. The attack rate was higher in Hoima compared to Buliisa District.

In a Swedish study, among 18 patients treated using Indomethacin for 6 months, 8 (44%) developed gastrointestinal related complications and 1 died [15]. Also, a casecontrol study conducted in the United Kingdom which consisted of 1457 cases of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding and 10000 control subjects, the relative risk associated with the use of NSAIDs was 4.7 (95% CI: 3.8-5.7) [13]. The clinical presentation of a distended abdomen among some of the case patients is of particular interest. Although in this investigation we did not find a statistically significant association between the history of self-reported schistosomiasis and hematemesis, the presentation of some cases with distended abdomens and the fact that one of three patients' stool specimens had positive identification of Schistosoma ova indicate that some of the case-patients have schistosomiasis.
