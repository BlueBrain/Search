CaKV was first described in fecal samples from diarrheic dogs in the USA in 2011, with subsequent reports in the UK, Italy, South Korea, China, Tanzania, and Japan. CaKV is frequently identified in feces of animals with or without clinical signs of gastroenteritis. The present study investigated the presence of CaKV in fecal samples from 53 diarrheic dogs from Londrina, southern Brazil. Using a RT-PCR assay, CaKV RNA was identified in three dogs, resulting in an overall occurrence rate of 5.7%. In addition, coinfection with canine parvovirus subtype 2b was detected in all CaKV-positive diarrheic fecal samples. Using a phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 gene sequence, the Brazilian CaKV field strains were found to be very similar to a previously identified CaKV strain from Brazil that was found in the tissue of a puppy and were also found to be clustered with other CaKV strains detected worldwide and other kobuvirus strains identified in mouse, feline, and human hosts.",

A study in China [15] reported coinfection of CaKV-infected dogs with other viral agents but also identified diarrheic dogs that were infected only with CaKV, suggesting that CaKV alone may be capable of causing infections in the canine population. Moreover, a previous study in Brazil [21] identified CaKV in multiple tissues from a puppy that was coinfected with other viral (CDV, CPV-2, CaHV-1) and parasitic agents, confirming the systemic distribution of the virus; however, CaKV was not detected by RT-PCR in the feces or intestine of the puppy. The authors suggested that a more sensitive assay might be required to detect this virus when there is concomitant infection with other severe intestinal diseases.",

However, phylogenetic analysis based on the partial VP1 gene sequence that encodes the more variable CaKV protein allowed us to obtain information on the genetic relationships among the strains we identified and other CaKV strains worldwide, as well as the various other members of the Kobuvirus genus. The CaKV strains identified in this study were found to be similar (nt identity 92%) to those previously reported in Brazil that were identified from tissues from a puppy, and the strain from nondiarrheic dogs (nt identity 89.2-90.4%), being classified into the same clade. However, these CaKV strains were placed into different clades than those detected in the UK (nt identity 90.4-91.2%), Tanzania (nt identity 88-89.2%), the USA (nt identity 86.8-87.2%), and Asian countries (nt identity South Korea 87.6-88.4% and China 80.8-81.2%). The Brazilian CaKV strains from this study had 71%, 68%, and 65% nt similarity with the feline, mouse, and human kobuviruses, respectively.
