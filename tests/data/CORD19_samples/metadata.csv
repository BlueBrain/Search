8q5ondtn,,Elsevier,Intrauterine virus infections and congenital heart disease,10.1016/0002-8703(72)90077-4,,4361535.0,els-covid,"Abstract The etiologic basis for the vast majority of cases of congenital heart disease remains largely undefined. Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.",1972-12-31,"Overall, James C.",American Heart Journal,,,False,False,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-8703(72)90077-4

It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.",1985-06-28,"Garibaldi, Richard A.",The American Journal of Medicine,,,False,False,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9343(85)90361-4

The expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various DC subsets and haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which generate DCs, remain to be fully identified. Here we examine miRNomes of mouse bone marrow HSCs, immature DCs, mature DCs and IL-10/NO-producing regulatory DCs by deep sequencing. We identify numerous stage-specific miRNAs and histone modification in HSCs and DCs at different differentiation stages. miR-30b, significantly upregulated via a TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated epigenetic pathway in regulatory DCs, can target Notch1 to promote IL-10 and NO production, suggesting that miR-30b is a negative regulator of immune response. We also identify miRNomes of in vivo counterparts of mature DCs and regulatory DCs and systematically compare them with DCs cultured in vitro. These results provide a resource for studying roles of miRNAs in stem cell biology, development and functional regulation of DC subsets.",2013-12-06,"Su, Xiaoping; Qian, Cheng; Zhang, Qian; Hou, Jin; Gu, Yan; Han, Yanmei; Chen, Yongjian; Jiang, Minghong; Cao, Xuetao",Nat Commun,,,True,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863901/

We conducted an investigation to verify the existence of an outbreak and to identify the disease nature, mode of transmission and risk factors. METHODS: We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis between 1 June 2015 and 15 October 2015 in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or neighbouring districts. We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed case-patients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (± 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. RESULTS: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness. In the case-control study, 42% (5/12) of cases vs. 0.0% (0/77) of controls had liver disease (OR(M-H) = ∞; 95%CI = 3.7-∞); 71% (10/14) of cases vs. 35% (28/81) of controls had ulcer disease (OR(M-H) = 13; 95% CI = 1.6-98); 27% (3/11) of cases vs. 14% (11/81) of controls used indomethacin prior to disease onset (OR(M-H) = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.0-36). None of the blood samples were positive for any of the VHFs. CONCLUSION: This reported cluster of hematemesis illness was due to predisposing conditions and use of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). Health education should be conducted on the danger of NSAIDs misuse, especially in persons with pre-disposing conditions.",2017-11-08,"Kabwama, Steven Ndugwa; Mafigiri, Richardson; Balinandi, Stephen; Kagirita, Atek; Riolexus, Alex Ario; Zhu, Bao-Ping",Pan Afr Med J,,,True,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878846/

CaKV was first described in fecal samples from diarrheic dogs in the USA in 2011, with subsequent reports in the UK, Italy, South Korea, China, Tanzania, and Japan. CaKV is frequently identified in feces of animals with or without clinical signs of gastroenteritis. The present study investigated the presence of CaKV in fecal samples from 53 diarrheic dogs from Londrina, southern Brazil. Using a RT-PCR assay, CaKV RNA was identified in three dogs, resulting in an overall occurrence rate of 5.7%. In addition, coinfection with canine parvovirus subtype 2b was detected in all CaKV-positive diarrheic fecal samples. Using a phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 gene sequence, the Brazilian CaKV field strains were found to be very similar to a previously identified CaKV strain from Brazil that was found in the tissue of a puppy and were also found to be clustered with other CaKV strains detected worldwide and other kobuvirus strains identified in mouse, feline, and human hosts.",2019-05-28,"Miyabe, Flavia Megumi; Ribeiro, Juliane; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo",Braz J Microbiol,,,True,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6863268/

As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (<= 10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.",2020-03-13,Jie Liu; Liu Ouyang; Pi Guo; Hai sheng Wu; Peng Fu; Yu liang Chen; Dan Yang; Xiao yu Han; Yu kun Cao; Osamah Alwalid; Juan Tao; Shu yi Peng; He shui Shi; Fan Yang; Chuan sheng Zheng,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033118

This virus was named the Mogiana tick virus (MGTV). Later, MGTV was also named as Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), Kindia tick virus (KDTV), Guangxi tick virus (GXTV) etc. In the present study, we used small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to detect viruses in ticks and detected MGTV in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks, which had been captured in Yunnan province of China in the year of 2016. The full-length genome sequence of a new MGTV strain Yunnan2016 (GenBank: MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100) was obtained and recommended to be included into the NCBI RefSeq database for the future studies of MGTV. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that viruses named MGTV, JMTV, KDTV and GXTV are monophyletic: the MGTV group (lineage) of viruses. We show, for the first time, that 5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to obtain full-length sequences of the 5’ and 3’ ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses.
