The expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various DC subsets and haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which generate DCs, remain to be fully identified. Here we examine miRNomes of mouse bone marrow HSCs, immature DCs, mature DCs and IL-10/NO-producing regulatory DCs by deep sequencing. We identify numerous stage-specific miRNAs and histone modification in HSCs and DCs at different differentiation stages. miR-30b, significantly upregulated via a TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated epigenetic pathway in regulatory DCs, can target Notch1 to promote IL-10 and NO production, suggesting that miR-30b is a negative regulator of immune response. We also identify miRNomes of in vivo counterparts of mature DCs and regulatory DCs and systematically compare them with DCs cultured in vitro. These results provide a resource for studying roles of miRNAs in stem cell biology, development and functional regulation of DC subsets.",

Together with all blood cells, DCs have their ultimate origin in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs have the capacity to self-renew over the lifespan and also to give rise to a series of precursor cells that are progressively committed to particular cell lineages 2 . Which precursor type will actually generate DCs will depend on the availability of precursors and the immune microenvironment involved 3 . In most circumstances, myeloid precursors are the main sources to generate DCs. DCs comprise a network of subsets that differ in location, migratory pathways, detailed immunological function and dependence on stimuli for their generation, adding further layers of complexity in the coordination of immune responses 4 . The developmental pathways that lead HSCs to the different DC subsets are very important, not just in the initial establishment of the DC network, but as dynamic components of the response to microbial invasion and the maintenance of immune homeostasis 5 . Although the development and differentiation pathways have been simply mapped and much knowledge has been gained about the origins, phenotypes and functions of mouse DC subsets, examining the mechanisms of gene regulation that underlie development from HSCs to different DC subsets has the potential to improve our understanding of cell differentiation in general and to provide insights for the development of clinically relevant DC-based immunotherapy.",

Upon inflammatory stimulation or uptake of pathogenic antigens, immature DCs (imDCs) undergo maturation and differentiate into mature DCs (maDCs), which are originally considered to be terminally differentiated 14 . However, our previous study demonstrated that splenic stromal cells, which mimic the secondary lymph organ microenvironment, can drive maDCs to further differentiate into regulatory DCs (DCreg) 15 . Therefore, the process of DC development and differentiation is very interesting, as it includes one development process (HSCs-imDCs), one maturation process (imDCs-maDCs) and one differentiation process (maDCs-DCreg), thus providing a good cell model to investigate how miRNAs are involved in different processes of cell differentiation and functional regulation. Up to now, a few studies have investigated this topic [16] [17] [18] [19] ; however, a comprehensive profile of miRNAs in mouse bone marrowderived DCs at different differentiation stages remain largely unknown.",

We demonstrate that about 391 miRNAs are differentially expressed during DC differentiation, with numerous stage-specific miRNAs regulated by histone modifications at different stages. A total of 121 miRNAs have the same alteration pattern during DC differentiation process (maDCs-DCreg) in vitro and in vivo. miR-30b, significantly upregulated in DCreg both in vitro and in vivo, is found to promote IL-10 and NO production through targeting Notch1.

Using unique perfectly mapped reads, a total of 5,865,224, 5,928,841, 6,324,361 and 3,983,460 reads were sequenced from the HSCs, imDCs, maDCs and DCreg libraries respectively. We assigned each of the small RNAs a unique annotation according to its precursor and classified these small RNAs into different categories such as known miRNA, rRNA and so on (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA), repeat (LINE, SINE, LTR), mRNA (exons/introns) and unannotated small RNAs. All libraries showed a similar small RNA distribution. On average, 90.92% matched annotated miRNA hairpins; 7.06% matched rRNA, and so on.; 1.35% matched mRNAs; 0.33% matched repeat elements and 0.34% were previously uncharacterized small RNAs (Fig. 1a) . The mapping and categorizing of clean reads revealed that most small RNA reads were miRNAs during DC development and differentiation. miRNAs are differentially expressed at different DC stages. In order to obtain the abundance value for each miRNA in each small RNA library, miRNAs in mouse miRBase v.19 were analysed and normalized to 'transcripts per million (TPM)' for each library. In order to depict the dynamic expression patterns of markedly changed miRNAs during DC development and differentiation, 391 miRNAs (TPM410 in at least one small RNA library, acounting for B99.9% of miRNome) were selected. The miRNA with more than double of expression variation between two analysed cell types was determined as differentially expressed miRNA. We further classified these miRNAs into the 26 possible dynamic expression patterns and calculated the number of miRNAs in each pattern. Fisher exact test was used to determine the significantly enriched patterns (Fig. 1b) . Analysis showed that most miRNAs were expressed preferentially at one or two stages of DCs, and only a few of them were highly expressed in all the stages of DCs, suggesting miRNAs with specific functions may be more related to the biological characteristics of different DC stages.",

As we reported previously, endothelial-like splenic stromal cells can secrete TGF-b to drive the differentiation from maDC to DCreg 15 . Therefore, we wondered whether the neutralizing antibody against TGF-b could influence miR-30b expression in DCreg. As shown in Fig. 5b , the addition of neutralizing antibody against TGF-b in the co-cultural system could decrease miR-30b expression in DCreg. Further, Smad3 deficiency decreased miR-30b expression in DCreg (Fig. 5c ). Furthermore, as acetylation level of histone in promoter region is always elevated by Smad3 activation 29, 30 , ChIP assays showed the upregulated histone H3 acetylation level and Smad3-binding activity in promoter region of miR-30b in DCreg compared with maDCs ( Fig. 5d-f ). To delineate whether Smad3 specifically binds miR-30b promoter in response to TGF-b, we performed silico analysis (rVista 2.0, http://rvista.dcode.org/) 31 to search for potential Smad-binding sites in miR-30b promoter. In this study, we found two potential Smad-binding sites in miR-30b promoter (Fig. 5g) . To confirm this finding, we used luciferase reporter assay to determine the interaction of Smad3 with the miR-30b promoter region in RAW264.7 cells.

As we reported previously 15, 32 , IL-10 and NO were preferentially produced in DCreg, acting as important negative regulators of immune response. Further, we found that miR-30b overexpression could enhance IL-10 and NO production in DCreg, whereas miR-30b inhibition could decrease their production (Fig. 6a) , indicating that miR-30b may contribute to the preferential IL-10 and NO production in DCreg. On a per-cell basis, similar results of IL-10 production were observed, as determined by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 6b) , further indicating that miR-30b influences IL-10 production by regulatory DCs. As miRNAs function mainly through repressing their targets, we examined the targets of miR-30b, which might modulate the preferential IL-10 and NO production in DCreg. By targets prediction of miR-30b via TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org), we found that mouse Notch1 had one putative conserved miR-30b target site (Fig. 6c) . To certify whether Notch1 was regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-30b, we constructed reporter plasmids containing the 3 0 UTR region of mouse Notch1, and found that its expression was significantly decreased by miR-30b co-transfection (Fig. 6d ). Furthermore, Notch1 protein level was decreased by miR-30b overexpression, whereas elevated by miR-30b inhibition in DCs (Fig. 6e) , confirming that miR-30b targets Notch1. Similar results were observed in flow cytometry analysis of the surface expression of Notch1 on DCs after miR30b manipulation (Fig. 6f) , further confirming that miR-30b targets Notch1.",

In the present study, the miRNomes of DC development and differentiation in vitro and in vivo, including HSCs, imDCs, maDCs and DCreg have been revealed. Our results reveal that, during DC development and differentiation, miRNA expression spectrums were similar, but miRNA expression profiles changed significantly, especially in DC development and differentiation processes. The miRNAs, preferentially expressed at one or two stages, may raise interesting future work to elucidate the detailed roles of these miRNAs in the regulation of DC development and differentiation.

In our previous report, endothelial-like splenic stromal cells can induce the differentiation from maDCs to DCreg, which is dependent on TGF-b production 15 . TGF-b is a pleiotropic growth factor that modulates immune response by controlling cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. Upon activation, TGF-b activates Smad3, which subsequently translocates into the nucleus and initiates transcription of target genes. Despite the known roles of TGF-b/Smad3 signaling in regulating immune response, such as modulation of cytokine production, its roles in regulating miRNA expression remain unknown. Here we showed that the enriched expression of miR-30b in DCreg was dependent on TGF-b/Smad3 signaling, and more Smad3 binding to the acetylated promoter region of miR-30b in DCreg. These data have suggested a new model of gene expression regulation mediated by activated TGF-b/Smad3 signaling, which may present indications in researching the mechanisms of TGF-b regulating immune response.",

Recently, the role of Notch signaling has been found to be important in the function of antigen-presenting cells 45 . Our work showed that Notch1 and downstream signaling, targeted by the enriched miR-30b expression in DCreg, negatively regulated the preferential IL-10 and NO production in DCreg, which is consistent with the recent report that Notch1 signaling could inhibit IL-10 production in macrophages stimulated with TLR agonists 46 . More recently, we demonstrated that Notch signaling suppressed TLR-triggered inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting ERK1/2mediated NF-kB activity in macrophages 47 . We previously found that upregulated IL-10 production might be due to enhanced activation of ERK1/2 in DCreg 48 . Our findings suggest that miR-30b can target Notch1 to retain the negative regulatory role of DCreg through enhanced activation of ERK1/2. In contrast, previous reports presented that Notch signaling was required for IL-10 production in T cells 49 . These discrepancies may be due to the distinct roles of Notch1 signaling in the different cell types, which may include the different epigenetic modification in the promoters of IL-10 and NO or the different activation of multiple transcription factors to the binding sites of IL-10 and NO promoter regions, thus suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different cell types.",

To date, Illumina sequencing analysis of the miRNomes in mouse bone marrow HSCs and DCs at different differentiation stages remains to be performed. The Illumina sequencing used in this study led to the identification of a large fraction of miRNA expressed during DC development and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. These included 53 new miRNA candidates, as well as a potentially distinct class of short RNAs not fulfilling current criteria for miRNAs. These findings have general implications for the understanding of the total miRNA content of the mouse genome as well as for future studies on the role of miRNAs in DC development, differentiation and function, and also in stem cell biology.Although most miRNAs are known and most of them are ubiquitously expressed 37 , additional analyses of purified cell populations have partially identified the existence of tissue-and stage-specific miRNAs in a few tissues.",
