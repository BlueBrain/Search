We assigned each of the small RNAs a unique annotation according to its precursor and classified these small RNAs into different categories such as known miRNA, rRNA and so on (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA), repeat (LINE, SINE, LTR), mRNA (exons/introns) and unannotated small RNAs. All libraries showed a similar small RNA distribution. On average, 90.92% matched annotated miRNA hairpins; 7.06% matched rRNA, and so on.; 1.35% matched mRNAs; 0.33% matched repeat elements and 0.34% were previously uncharacterized small RNAs (Fig. 1a).

The miRNA with more than double of expression variation between two analysed cell types was determined as differentially expressed miRNA. We further classified these miRNAs into the 26 possible dynamic expression patterns and calculated the number of miRNAs in each pattern. Fisher exact test was used to determine the significantly enriched patterns (Fig. 1b). Analysis showed that most miRNAs were expressed preferentially at one or two stages of DCs, and only a few of them were highly expressed in all the stages of DCs, suggesting miRNAs with specific functions may be more related to the biological characteristics of different DC stages.",

This difficulty persecuted the researches of epigenetic regulation for miRNAs. The regions (2,500 bp upstream, 500 bp downstream of pre-miRNA) were postulated as promoters of miRNAs to investigate the epigenetic regulation of miRNA expression25. So we chose this region as a potential promoter to investigate the epigenetic regulation of stage-specific miRNAs during DC development and differentiation. Acetylation of histone was a general marker associated with actively transcribed promoter26, and acetylation of histone in the promoter regions of stage-specific miRNAs were assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. For miRNA expression, miR-1 and miR-486 were highly expressed in HSCs, whereas poorly expressed in other three stages; miR-132 and miR-147 were highly expressed in imDCs and maDCs, whereas poorly expressed in HSCs and DCreg; and miR-125a-5p and miR-99a were highly expressed in DCreg, whereas poorly expressed in other three stages (Fig. 3a). These results were confirmed by qRT\u2013PCR assays (Fig. 3b), and pri-miRNA transcripts of these miRNAs were also confirmed by qRT\u2013PCR (Fig. 3c). ChIP assays on the potential promoters of the above stage-specific miRNAs were analysed using two sets of qPCR primers spanning the promoters (Fig. 3d), and results showed that acetylation of histone H3 in the promoter regions of miR-1-1 and miR-486 were high only in HSCs; acetylation of histone H3 in the promoter regions of miR-132 and miR-147 were high only in imDCs and maDCs, whereas acetylation of histone H3 in the promoter regions of miR-99a and miR-125a were high only in DCreg (Fig. 3e), which were consistent with the stage-specific expression of these miRNAs. Our results suggest that stage-specific miRNAs undergo epigenetic reprogramming during cell development and differentiation.",

            "text": "Interestingly, multiple differentially expressed miRNAs were detected at different stages of DC development and differentiation, thus suggesting that many miRNAs may function in this process. We found that, compared with maDCs, miR-30b expression significantly increased in DCreg (Fig. 5a). As we reported previously, endothelial-like splenic stromal cells can secrete TGF-\u03b2 to drive the differentiation from maDC to DCreg15. Therefore, we wondered whether the neutralizing antibody against TGF-\u03b2 could influence miR-30b expression in DCreg. As shown in Fig. 5b, the addition of neutralizing antibody against TGF-\u03b2 in the co-cultural system could decrease miR-30b expression in DCreg. Further, Smad3 deficiency decreased miR-30b expression in DCreg (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, as acetylation level of histone in promoter region is always elevated by Smad3 activation2930, ChIP assays showed the upregulated histone H3 acetylation level and Smad3-binding activity in promoter region of miR-30b in DCreg compared with maDCs (Fig. 5d\u2013f). To delineate whether Smad3 specifically binds miR-30b promoter in response to TGF-\u03b2, we performed silico analysis (rVista 2.0, http://rvista.dcode.org/)31 to search for potential Smad-binding sites in miR-30b promoter. In this study, we found two potential Smad-binding sites in miR-30b promoter (Fig. 5g). To confirm this finding, we used luciferase reporter assay to determine the interaction of Smad3 with the miR-30b promoter region in RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 5h, TGF-\u03b2 could successfully upregulate luciferase activity containing the potential Smad-binding sites (S1 and S2), supporting that Smad3 could physically interact with the miR-30b promoter region. These data demonstrated that upregulation of miR-30b expression in DCreg could be induced through TGF-\u03b2/Smad3-dependent pathway.",

In order to elucidate the alteration of individual miRNA, several methods, including qRT\u2013PCR34 and microarray35 techniques have been widely used in qualitative miRNA studies. However, these approaches have low throughput with low sensitivity and poor resolution, which lack vigor in revealing the abundance of each miRNA in the background of the entire miRNome. At present, MPSS of miRNAs can identify the entire miRNome in-depth and explore miRNA expression differences as well as the individual miRNA abundance in a given tissue or cell type under a certain physiological or pathological context. We have carried out Illumina sequencing analysis to define the miRNomes in human liver and hepatocellular carcinoma36 and also in human NK cells10, revealing the miRNA candidates involved. To date, Illumina sequencing analysis of the miRNomes in mouse bone marrow HSCs and DCs at different differentiation stages remains to be performed. The Illumina sequencing used in this study led to the identification of a large fraction of miRNA expressed during DC development and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. These included 53 new miRNA candidates, as well as a potentially distinct class of short RNAs not fulfilling current criteria for miRNAs. These findings have general implications for the understanding of the total miRNA content of the mouse genome as well as for future studies on the role of miRNAs in DC development, differentiation and function, and also in stem cell biology.",

Our results reveal that, during DC development and differentiation, miRNA expression spectrums were similar, but miRNA expression profiles changed significantly, especially in DC development and differentiation processes. The miRNAs, preferentially expressed at one or two stages, may raise interesting future work to elucidate the detailed roles of these miRNAs in the regulation of DC development and differentiation.",

Many of these genes with tissue-specific expression undergo epigenetic reprogramming during cell development and differentiation4041. However, epigenetic regulation of non-protein-coding genes, especially miRNAs, is not yet clear. As reported, some tissue or stage-specific miRNAs are regulated by epigenetic modification in their promoter regions424344, such as the low miR-1-1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma was due to DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in its promoter region28. Therefore, we explored the possibility that whether stage-specific miRNAs were regulated by epigenetic modification in their promoter during DC development and differentiation. In the processes of DC development and differentiation, many miRNAs demonstrated stage-specific expression, and we have demonstrated that some of them were regulated by histone acetylation. However, as DNA methylation and histone methylation are also important epigenetic modifications in regulating gene expression, an interesting topic that remains to be investigated is whether the differentially expressed miRNAs in DC development and differentiation are also mediated by these epigenetic modifications.",

Based on analysis of miRNomes, we went further to find that, compared with maDCs, miR-30b expression was significantly enriched in DCreg in vitro and in vivo. We further investigated the underlying mechanism for the miR-30b enrichment in DCreg. In our previous report, endothelial-like splenic stromal cells can induce the differentiation from maDCs to DCreg, which is dependent on TGF-\u03b2 production15. TGF-\u03b2 is a pleiotropic growth factor that modulates immune response by controlling cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. Upon activation, TGF-\u03b2 activates Smad3, which subsequently translocates into the nucleus and initiates transcription of target genes. Despite the known roles of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in regulating immune response, such as modulation of cytokine production, its roles in regulating miRNA expression remain unknown. Here we showed that the enriched expression of miR-30b in DCreg was dependent on TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, and more Smad3 binding to the acetylated promoter region of miR-30b in DCreg. These data have suggested a new model of gene expression regulation mediated by activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, which may present indications in researching the mechanisms of TGF-\u03b2 regulating immune response.",

Recently, the role of Notch signaling has been found to be important in the function of antigen-presenting cells45. Our work showed that Notch1 and downstream signaling, targeted by the enriched miR-30b expression in DCreg, negatively regulated the preferential IL-10 and NO production in DCreg, which is consistent with the recent report that Notch1 signaling could inhibit IL-10 production in macrophages stimulated with TLR agonists46. More recently, we demonstrated that Notch signaling suppressed TLR-triggered inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting ERK1/2-mediated NF-\u03baB activity in macrophages47. We previously found that upregulated IL-10 production might be due to enhanced activation of ERK1/2 in DCreg48. Our findings suggest that miR-30b can target Notch1 to retain the negative regulatory role of DCreg through enhanced activation of ERK1/2. In contrast, previous reports presented that Notch signaling was required for IL-10 production in T cells49. These discrepancies may be due to the distinct roles of Notch1 signaling in the different cell types, which may include the different epigenetic modification in the promoters of IL-10 and NO or the different activation of multiple transcription factors to the binding sites of IL-10 and NO promoter regions, thus suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different cell types.",
