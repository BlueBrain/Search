In the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment, cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies are urgently needed. Methods: Here, we have used RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples collected during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the Region of Valencia, Spain. Results: We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases. Interpretation: Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and show that wastewater analysis is a sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has rapidly led to a pandemic scenario, with over 2\u20226 million COVID-19 confirmed cases globally as of April 23, 2020. COVID-19 symptoms are varied and often non-specific, including fever, cough, and diarrhea, among others. A non-negligible percentage of infected people develop pneumonia, which can subsequently lead to severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, organ failure, viral sepsis, and death 1 . The widespread nature of the pandemics and the lack of easy symptom-based diagnosis, treatment, or vaccine has enforced drastic and extremely costly epidemiological control measures including worldwide lockdowns. Whereas massive RT-qPCR testing campaigns are being deployed in many countries to assess the actual prevalence of the virus, this is not a feasible surveillance strategy for the general population over the long term.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Spain now stands as the second most extensively affected country worldwide with over 200,000 confirmed COVID-19 infections and more than 20,000 deaths.

This implies that wastewaters may contain viral particles or viral RNA that could be used as an epidemiological surveillance tool. Wastewaters can also collect viruses present in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract that are shed during personal hygiene. Compared to systematic testing of individuals, wastewater analysis is obviously less invasive, simpler and cheaper, but the sensitivity and reliability of this method remains to be shown.

Some samples were collected before and after wastewater treatment, and all samples were kept at 4\u00b0C until analysis. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is stable at 4\u00b0C for at least 14 days 19, 22 .
