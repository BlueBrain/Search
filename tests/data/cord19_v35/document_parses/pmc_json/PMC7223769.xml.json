In these instances, the vaccine targets the viral causative agent and not the cancer itself. Indirect evidence to support the possibility of using host immunity in the fight against non-virally induced cancers comes in the form of the success story that are the checkpoint inhibitors. These immunotherapies show us that an anti-tumor T cell response is mounted but becomes impaired along the way by the immunosuppressive microenvironment. \u2018Taking the brakes off the system\u2019 with these checkpoint inhibitors reveals just how effective an anti-tumor immune response can be [1].",

Active surveillance, radiation and radical prostatectomy are the most common treatment options in the management of early stages of prostate cancer. Although these treatments have very good 5-year survival rates (approaching 100%), albeit with a range of potential side effects, it is estimated that 20\u201330% of patients will show signs of disease recurrence after the 5-year follow-up period (www.pcf.org). Priming the immune system so that it may be able to assist in \u2018mopping up\u2019 cancerous cells that remain following radiation or surgery, reveals a window of opportunity for adjunctive vaccination in the treatment/management of prostate cancer. A challenge to this opportunity is the immunologically \u2018cold\u2019 nature of prostate cancer and this challenge is clear when you consider that only one prostate cancer vaccine has been approved since 2010. Patients vaccinated with the FDA approved PROVENGE\u00ae-PAP-GM-CSF loaded antigen presenting cells, an autologous cellular cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), experienced median survival benefits of 4.1 months [3]. The phase III PROSPECT trial for the prostate vaccine development by Bavarian Nordic, PROSTVAC, failed to show an overall survival benefit as a monotherapy [4] but clinical trials exploring its potential in combination strategies are ongoing.",

Combination strategies aim to elicit anti-tumor immune responses of greater magnitude and quality capable of overcoming tumor immunosuppression or resistance mechanisms. Most immunomodulatory strategies have focussed on reactivating T cells but there is scope to expand on these strategies to boost innate immune responses. NK cells have long been recognized for their potential to kill cancer cells and have been exploited in a range of therapeutic approaches such as autologous cell transfer, monoclonal antibodies engineered for increased ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) activity, chimeric antigen receptors [8\u201310] and are potential targets for checkpoint inhibitors [11\u201313]. Designing immunotherapies that stimulate NK cells in addition to effector T cells could result in more effective therapies by harnessing the full complement of NK-driven anti-tumor effector mechanisms [14, 15].",

Initial studies in cancer models demonstrated that ISCOMATRIX\u2122 adjuvanted vaccines, comprising tumor antigen and adjuvant, were efficacious in the prophylactic setting [16, 17] but for effectiveness in the therapeutic setting, it is likely that additional vaccine components would be required. Recently, we and others have sought to combine multiple adjuvants in an effort to improve the efficacy of vaccines containing poorly immunogenic antigens and cancer vaccines [18\u201322]. The addition of PolyI:C and CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) and a tumor antigen revealed the potential of an ISCOMATRIX\u2122 adjuvant and TLR agonist combination cancer vaccine [22]. In this present study, we examine the effectiveness of a prostate cancer vaccine that combines the ISCOMATRIX\u2122 adjuvant and the tumor antigen mPAP with the TLR3 agonist, Poly I:C, and the immunostimulatory cytokine Flt3L. The goal of this study was to identify a vaccine that could provide therapeutic protection against a poorly immunogenic tumor. Moreover, the mechanism of action (MoA) of this combination therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine was probed. These studies revealed that NK cells and CD4+ T cells, optimally stimulated by this vaccine combination, can drive an effective anti-tumor immune response that can overcome the need for CD8+ T cells that were found to acquire an exhausted phenotype over time. The vaccine revealed striking effects on NK cell activation and function and induced a robust protective memory response. Importantly, the vaccine showed impact on prostate weight in the pre-metastatic phase in a model of spontaneous prostate cancer that more closely reflects the human disease. In addition, the vaccine has potential for broader application as we demonstrated significant efficacy in the melanoma (B16-OVA) and lymphoma (E\u00b5-myc-OVA) mouse models.",

When the tumor antigen mPAP was absent from the vaccine combination, tumor growth proceeded unchecked, whereas when mPAP was included, tumor growth was better controlled (Fig. 1d) and animals experienced improved survival (Fig. 1e). To assess the potential of the ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L vaccine to induce memory, vaccinated mice previously challenged with TRAMP-C1 tumors that had become tumor-free and had remained so for ~ 100 days, were rechallenged with TRAMP-C1 tumors. Vaccinated animals were protected from rechallenge with TRAMP-C1 tumors (Fig. 1f), with 80% of animals remaining free of tumor (Fig. 1g). As expected all age-matched unvaccinated animals receiving a primary TRAMP-C1 challenge succumbed to their tumor burdens. The resistance to rechallenge with TRAMP-C1 tumors indicates that the ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L vaccine is indeed able to induce a robust and persistent protective memory response.",

Analysis of TRAMPC1 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by staining of dissociated tumors identified that CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells all infiltrate TRAMP-C1 tumors (Fig. 2a) TRAMP-C1 tumor growth was monitored in vaccinated animals that had been depleted of NK cells, CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells. In the absence of both NK cells (Fig. 2, left panel) and CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2, middle panel), the ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L vaccine was no longer able to control TRAMP-C1 tumor growth. All animals lacking NK cells or CD4+ T cells were euthanized with maximal tumor burdens, and the tumor grew with kinetics similar to that of untreated animals. This observation indicates that both NK and CD4 T+ cell-mediated mechanisms contributed to the anti-tumor response induced by this vaccine. Surprisingly vaccinated animals depleted of CD8+ T cells were not impaired in their capacity to control tumor growth (Fig. 2, right panel). CD8+ T cells were shown to infiltrate TRAMPC1 tumors (Fig. 2a) but a time-course analysis of CD8+ TILs from unvaccinated animals revealed that these cells acquired an exhausted PD1+TIM3+ phenotype [27] overtime (Fig. 2d) limiting their ability to participate in the anti-tumor immune response. While CD8+ T cells may not contribute significantly to reducing the volume of tumor material as measured in these experiments, CD8+ T cells that have been instructed by the ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L vaccine are likely responsible for the robust and persistent memory responses observed.

NK cell expansion is not unexpected given repeat administration of soluble human Flt3L has been shown to expand NK cell numbers [31]. Administration of Flt3L alone does indeed increase NK cell numbers as seen post-boost in the spleen (after which mice have received 10ug of Flt3L over 9 days) (Supplementary Fig. 2) but the increase of the NK cell numbers with the ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L vaccine is even greater. NK cells displayed higher levels of the early activation marker CD69 when exposed to the full vaccine combination (Fig. 3b). Poly I:C itself is a strong stimulus for CD69 expression on NK cells [32] and we did find that CD69 expression went up on cells treated with Poly I:C alone or the vaccine combination ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C (Fig. 3b). These findings suggest that the components of our vaccine synergise to stimulate NK cells of greater magnitude and superior activation than can be attributed to Poly I:C alone.",

NK cells secrete cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, that participate in the shaping of the adaptive immune response [33]. Following vaccination, NK cells express more IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3c, d) than animals having received ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP or ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C. Poly I:C alone can directly stimulate NK cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 [32]. We detected IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells following Poly I:C stimulation alone but IFN-\u03b3 levels were lower in this group as compared to animals vaccinated with the full combination vaccine (Fig. 3c). As another measure of NK function we assessed the expression of the cytotoxic mediator GzmB. As was the case for NK cell expansion, CD69 and IFN-\u03b3 expression, GzmB levels were greatest in animals vaccinated with ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L (Fig. 3e, f). Taking together these findings indicate that vaccination with ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L generates NK cells that are phenotypically and functionally primed for elimination of TRAMP-C1 tumors. Dissecting NK cell responsiveness after exposure to individual vaccine components in ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP, PolyI:C and Flt3L, compared to the full vaccine combination, highlights that the immunogenicity of the combination is greater than just the sum of its parts.",

To do this we moved to the TRAMP Tg mice, from which the TRAMP-C1 cell line was derived. These mice express the SV40 large T antigen oncogene under transcriptional control of the prostate-specific rat probasin promoter. Orthotopic prostate tumors spontaneously develop from the age of 10 weeks, which histologically resemble human prostate cancer [24]. TRAMP Tg mice were vaccinated with a prime at 6 weeks and 1 week later were boosted with ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP + Poly I:C + Flt3L. Mice received nine consecutive doses of Flt3L from the day of prime. At week 15 (well-moderately differentiated carcinomas) or weeks 21\u201324 (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma) [34] mice were weighed and prostates, ampullary glands and seminal vesicles were collected, weighed and fixed for histological analysis. These time points were selected for analysis as they represented primary disease and not metastatic disease. Metastatic disease is a setting in which the disease burden would likely be too great to be impacted by adjunctive vaccination as is the concept presented in this study. At week 15 there was no difference in prostate weights, an indicator of disease burden, compared to littermate controls, however by 21\u201324 weeks, mice vaccinated with ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP + Poly I:C + Flt3L showed a reduction in prostate + seminal vesicle weight compared to littermate controls (Fig. 5a). Although a reduction in prostate/seminal vesicle wet weight indicates an impact of macroscopic disease burden, histological analysis indicated differentiation to adenocarcinoma was not interrupted (data not shown) by vaccination with ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP + Poly I:C + Flt3L.",

We speculated that by combining immunomodulators from different classes, not just TLR ligands, a more protective vaccine response could be induced with better translational potential. With this aim we identified the vaccine combination ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013mPAP\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L. This therapeutic combination vaccine shows efficacy in the TRAMP-C1 model of prostate cancer when delivered in a prime-boost regime. This vaccine: (1) is effective against a high tumor burden, as a function of either a large tumour inoculum or a delayed vaccine schedule (2) generates a memory response that can protect against rechallenge (3) can limit prostate tumor burden in a model in which progression to adenocarcinoma is genetically predetermined and (4) demonstrates effectiveness in solid tumors and a model of B cell lymphoma.",

Direct stimulation of TRAMP-C1 cells with Poly I:C has been shown to have no direct effect on tumor cell growth but TRAMP tumor growth in TLR3-/- animals implicates signalling through TLR3 on immune and or stromal cells in anti-tumor immunity [37]. Others have shown administration of Poly I:C to suppress the growth of TRAMP tumors and lead to the recruitment of T cells and NK cells to the tumor site. Orthotopic prostate tumors from Poly I:C treated TRAMP mice were also found to be impaired histologically in their state of adenocarcinoma progression [37]. It is important to note that these results were achieved using serial doses of fifty times more Poly I:C than used in this present study. Although we were unable to prevent the programmed progression of adenocarcinoma in TRAMP-Tg mice we have potentially impacted the number of tumor cells undergoing these changes. Our vaccinated animals showed reduced prostate weight, a surrogate indicator of disease burden. Ciavarra et al. [38] demonstrated that TRAMP-C1 tumor growth could be slowed by 21 or 35 days of systemic administration of Flt3L protein given at an equivalent dose as used in this current study. This effect was lost upon withdrawal of treatment indicating that Flt3L administration alone does not elicit persistent protective immunity against the TRAMP-C1 tumors. Flt3L is a potent hemopoietic cytokine which in addition to enhancing antitumor priming by promoting host dendritic cell expansion [39, 40], promotes expansion of NK cell progenitors [31]. In the setting of vaccination specifically, elevated serum Flt3L levels are known to be detected soon after s.c. immunization with adjuvant (TLR ligands) and protein antigen and the ensuing Flt3 signalling is required for optimal immunity. In this study, Flt3L dosed for nine consecutive days did expand NK cell numbers and combined with the other vaccine components was able to synergistically enhance NK cell activation.",

NK cells are thought to play a role in the TRAMP prostate cancer mouse model with NKG2D-deficient TRAMP mice exhibiting a higher incidence of early-arising prostate adenocarcinomas, suggesting a role for early NKG2D-driven NK cell immune-surveillance in these mice [41]. Similarly, humanized transgenic TRAMP mice expressing the soluble NKG2G ligand\u2014MICB\u2014exhibited increased incidence of progressed carcinomas and metastasis [42]. A study investigating NK cells that infiltrate human prostate cancer showed NK cells to have an immature phenotype with low cytotoxic potential. This study also found that the balance between activatory and inhibitory receptors on prostate tumor infiltrating NK cells was altered and this tip towards increased expression of inhibitory receptors was more pronounced with metastatic progression [43]. These findings highlight that an immunotherapy able to improve NK cell anti-tumor activity, such as our vaccine, could contribute to overcoming this prostate-driven NK cell immunosuppression observed in humans.",

In addition, using an ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013OVA\u2013Poly I:C\u2013CpG vaccine in B16-OVA tumor-bearing animals, found CD8+ T cells to be essential to the effectiveness of this vaccine [22]. We have three lines of evidence to support a limited role for CD8+ T cells in the primary immune response, paving the way for greater contributions by CD4+ T cells and NK cells as we have shown. Firstly, primary human prostate cancers have been shown to have low HLA class I expression, with 85% of primary tumors displaying HLA class I downregulation. This level of MHC class I downregulation is greater than that observed in other tumor types [45]. Secondly, TRAMPC1 tumors have low MHC class I expression and that this expression can be improved with exposure to IFN-\u03b3 [38] limiting the ability of CD8+ T cells to directly engage with tumors. Thirdly, CD8+ T cells infiltrating TRAMPC1 tumors were found to acquire an exhausted phenotype suggesting they are unable to participate in the anti-tumor immune response to their fullest potential. Our vaccine combination was unable to overcome this exhaustion and engage CD8+ T cells drawing them into the response. It would be interesting to see if the addition of anti-PD1 to the combination would release CD8+ T cell from their supressed state and allow them to contribute to the response.",

The ability to mount a protective memory response suggests that antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells are generated during the primary tumor challenge and these cells are successfully recalled upon rechallenge. This does not exclude that memory CD4+ T cells are also recalled or the possibility that NK cells are again activated following rechallenge. A study by Cheadle et al. [46] investigating the potential of TLR7 agonism in improving anti-tumor efficacy of Obinutuzumab (glygoengineered \u03b1-CD20) in murine lymphoma models demonstrated that primary anti-tumor immunity was dependent on both NK cells an CD4+ T cells but not CD8+ T cells. The improved response observed is thought to reflect the ability of R848 to potentiate Obinutuzumab\u2019s effector mechanism, in particular Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by NK cells. Similarly, the anti-tumor immune response generated by our combination vaccine produces NK cells with enhanced effector function. Despite the observed non-participation of CD8+ T cells in the primary anti-lymphoma response, the conclusion was reached that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were necessary for the generation of long-term immunological memory.",

It is likely that vaccine-induced tumor control in these models, where the vaccine antigen stimulates an immunodominant CD8+ T cell response, may be CD8+ T cell-dependent. In support of this are immunogenicity studies conducted in the absence of tumor that show strong induction of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells (using OVA-tetramer) and numerous CD8+IFN\u03b3+ cells (data not shown) following prime-boost vaccination with ISCOMATRIX\u2122\u2013OVA\u2013Poly I:C\u2013Flt3L. Differential requirement for CD8+ T cells in control of tumor growth across different tumor models may reflect the difference between highly immunogenic tumor antigens like OVA and less immunogenic tumor antigens like PAP. We also demonstrate the impact of the tumor environment on the spectrum of anti-tumor immune response. We show here that CD8+ T cells are present in TRAMP tumors but they accumulate an exhausted phenotype overtime. It is likely that CD8+ TILs isolated from B16-OVA tumors would not show such a phenotype.",

These results highlight the potential for harnessing NK cells in the solid tumor setting where CD8+ T cells are either exhausted or fail to \u2018see\u2019 tumor antigen. The efficacy of this vaccine is also reliant on CD4+ T cells. It is possible that CD4+ T cells provide critical help that allow NK cells to perform optimally and potentially maintain long-term anti-tumor activity. From these studies where both the immunogenicity of the tumor is known and the immune mechanisms behind a particular vaccine combination is largely understood, we can begin to tailor future vaccine combinations to trigger the immune responses that are likely to be most effective against a given tumor. In the setting of a limited tumor burden, i.e., minimal residual disease following medical interventions such as radiation or surgery or in the setting where disease is slow-growing and non-progressive, there is a significant opportunity for the application of an immune-stimulating vaccine.",
