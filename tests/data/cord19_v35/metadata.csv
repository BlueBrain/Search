Currently, there is only one FDA approved vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer and as such prostate cancer continues to present a significant unmet medical need. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a therapeutic cancer vaccine that combines the ISCOMATRIX™ adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX) with the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), and Flt3L, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand. We employed the TRAMP-C1 (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) model of prostate cancer and the self-protein mPAP (prostatic acid phosphatase) as the tumor antigen. ISCOMATRIX™–mPAP–Poly I:C–Flt3L was delivered in a therapeutic prime-boost regime that was consistently able to achieve complete tumor regression in 60% of animals treated and these tumor-free animals were protected upon rechallenge. Investigations into the underlying immunological mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of this vaccine identified that both innate and adaptive responses are elicited and required. NK cells, CD4(+) T cells and interferon-γ were all found to be critical for tumor control while tumor infiltrating CD8(+) T cells became disabled by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. There is potential for broader application of this cancer vaccine, as we have been able to demonstrate effectiveness in two additional cancer models; melanoma (B16-OVA) and a model of B cell lymphoma (Eµ-myc-GFP-OVA).

In the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment, cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies are urgently needed. Methods: Here, we have used RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples collected during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the Region of Valencia, Spain. Results: We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases. Interpretation: Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and show that wastewater analysis is a sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.",2020-04-27,"Randazzo, Walter; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Sanjuan, Rafael; Domingo-Calap, Pilar; Sanchez, Gloria",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5f267fa1ef3a65e239aa974329e935a4d93dafd2.json,,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076679v1?rss=1,216145011.0
